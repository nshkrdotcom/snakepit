# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Memory Safety and Concurrency Control system provides thread-safe, process-safe access to shared memory regions in Snakepit's zero-copy architecture. Building on v0.6.0 thread profiles and the shared memory management system, this component ensures data integrity, prevents race conditions, and manages concurrent access patterns while maintaining high performance for zero-copy data transfer.

The system implements sophisticated synchronization primitives, deadlock prevention, memory barriers, and crash recovery mechanisms to ensure safe concurrent operations across BEAM processes and Python threads in production environments.

## Requirements

2. WHEN one thread writes while others read THEN proper memory barriers SHALL ensure readers see consistent state
3. WHEN multiple threads attempt concurrent writes THEN synchronization SHALL prevent data corruption and race conditions
4. WHEN thread synchronization is required THEN it SHALL complete within configurable timeout limits to prevent deadlocks
5. WHEN synchronization fails THEN detailed error information SHALL be provided for debugging and recovery

### Requirement 2: Process-Safe Memory Coordination
