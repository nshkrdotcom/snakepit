# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Data Serialization Framework provides intelligent, high-performance serialization for zero-copy data transfer between BEAM and Python processes. This system automatically selects optimal serialization formats (Arrow IPC, raw binary, NumPy pickle) based on data types and performance characteristics, enabling seamless data exchange while maximizing performance and minimizing memory overhead.

The framework implements format detection, schema evolution, type mapping, and performance optimization to ensure efficient data serialization across different data types and use cases in the zero-copy architecture.
