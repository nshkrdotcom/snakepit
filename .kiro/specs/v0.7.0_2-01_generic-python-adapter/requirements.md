# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Generic Python Adapter System eliminates the need for custom adapter code by providing zero-code integration with any Python library. Currently, adding new Python libraries to Snakepit requires writing custom adapters, which is the #1 adoption barrier. This system implements automatic function discovery, type mapping, and configuration-driven library loading to enable immediate usage of any Python library through simple configuration.

The system provides a declarative approach where users specify Python libraries in configuration, and Snakepit automatically makes all library functions available through a standardized interface, complete with automatic type conversion and error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Configuration-Driven Library Loading

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to add any Python library to Snakepit through configuration alone, so that I can use libraries immediately without writing custom adapter code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add a library to configuration THEN all public functions SHALL be automatically available for execution
2. WHEN I specify a pip package name THEN the system SHALL automatically install the package if not present
3. WHEN I configure a library module path THEN the system SHALL load and introspect the module automatically
4. WHEN I restart the application THEN all configured libraries SHALL be loaded and ready for use
5. WHEN library configuration is invalid THEN clear error messages SHALL guide me to fix the configuration

### Requirement 2: Automatic Function Discovery and Registration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic discovery of all callable functions in a Python library, so that I don't need to manually register each function I want to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a library is loaded THEN all public functions and methods SHALL be automatically discovered
2. WHEN functions have docstrings THEN the documentation SHALL be preserved and accessible
3. WHEN functions have type hints THEN the type information SHALL be captured for validation
4. WHEN classes are present THEN both static methods and instance methods SHALL be discoverable
5. WHEN nested modules exist THEN functions from submodules SHALL be accessible with dot notation

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Type Mapping and Conversion

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic conversion between Elixir and Python data types, so that I can pass native Elixir data structures without manual serialization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I pass Elixir maps THEN they SHALL be automatically converted to Python dictionaries
2. WHEN I pass Elixir lists THEN they SHALL be converted to appropriate Python collections (list, tuple, set)
3. WHEN Python functions return complex objects THEN they SHALL be serialized to Elixir-compatible formats
4. WHEN binary data is involved THEN it SHALL be handled efficiently without corruption
5. WHEN type conversion fails THEN descriptive error messages SHALL explain the conversion issue

### Requirement 4: Advanced Data Type Support

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want support for complex Python data types like NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames, so that I can use ML and data processing libraries effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN functions return NumPy arrays THEN they SHALL be converted to Elixir binary or list formats
2. WHEN functions return Pandas DataFrames THEN they SHALL be serialized to structured Elixir data
3. WHEN large datasets are involved THEN binary optimization SHALL be used for efficient transfer
4. WHEN streaming data is returned THEN it SHALL be handled incrementally without memory exhaustion
5. WHEN custom Python objects are returned THEN they SHALL be serialized using configurable strategies

### Requirement 5: Dynamic Function Execution Interface

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want a simple, consistent interface for calling any Python function, so that I can integrate Python libraries with minimal code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call `Snakepit.execute("library.function", args)` THEN the function SHALL be executed with automatic type conversion
2. WHEN I use dot notation for nested functions THEN the system SHALL resolve the correct function path
3. WHEN I pass keyword arguments THEN they SHALL be properly mapped to Python function parameters
4. WHEN functions have default parameters THEN I SHALL be able to omit them in calls
5. WHEN function signatures are complex THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages for incorrect usage

### Requirement 6: Library Lifecycle and Dependency Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automatic dependency management and library lifecycle handling, so that Python libraries are properly installed and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a library is configured THEN its dependencies SHALL be automatically resolved and installed
2. WHEN pip packages are specified THEN they SHALL be installed in the correct Python environment
3. WHEN library versions are specified THEN the exact versions SHALL be installed and validated
4. WHEN libraries have conflicting dependencies THEN clear error messages SHALL indicate the conflicts
5. WHEN libraries are removed from configuration THEN they SHALL be properly unloaded from memory

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Debugging Support

**User Story:** As a developer debugging Python integration issues, I want comprehensive error information and debugging tools, so that I can quickly identify and fix problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Python exceptions occur THEN full stack traces SHALL be propagated to Elixir with context
2. WHEN function calls fail THEN error messages SHALL include function signature and parameter information
3. WHEN type conversion fails THEN errors SHALL specify which types were involved and why conversion failed
4. WHEN library loading fails THEN errors SHALL indicate missing dependencies or configuration issues
5. WHEN debugging mode is enabled THEN detailed execution logs SHALL be available for troubleshooting

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization and Caching

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want efficient execution and caching of Python function calls, so that the generic adapter doesn't introduce significant overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN functions are called repeatedly THEN function metadata SHALL be cached to avoid re-introspection
2. WHEN large data is transferred THEN binary serialization SHALL be used for optimal performance
3. WHEN functions are pure THEN results SHALL be cacheable with configurable TTL
4. WHEN libraries are loaded THEN initialization overhead SHALL be minimized through lazy loading
5. WHEN measuring performance THEN the generic adapter overhead SHALL be less than 10% of direct calls

### Requirement 9: Security and Sandboxing

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want safe execution of arbitrary Python code, so that the generic adapter doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN libraries are loaded THEN only explicitly configured libraries SHALL be accessible
2. WHEN functions are executed THEN they SHALL run within the same security context as custom adapters
3. WHEN dangerous functions are detected THEN they SHALL be blocked or require explicit approval
4. WHEN file system access is attempted THEN it SHALL be subject to the same restrictions as other adapters
5. WHEN network access is attempted THEN it SHALL follow existing security policies

### Requirement 10: Configuration Validation and Documentation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive configuration validation and auto-generated documentation, so that I can manage Python library integrations effectively.

2. WHEN libraries are introspected THEN function documentation SHALL be automatically generated
3. WHEN configuration errors exist THEN specific line numbers and correction suggestions SHALL be provided

5. WHEN generating API documentation THEN it SHALL include both Elixir and Python function signatures

### Requirement 11: Integration with Existing Snakepit Features

### Requirement 12: Extensibility and Customization
