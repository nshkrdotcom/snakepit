# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Performance Optimization and Thresholds system provides intelligent decision-making for zero-copy data transfer in Snakepit v0.8.0. This system dynamically determines when to use zero-copy shared memory versus traditional gRPC serialization based on data characteristics, system load, and historical performance data. It continuously monitors performance, adapts thresholds, and provides optimization recommendations to maximize throughput while minimizing latency and resource usage.

This system is critical for achieving the promised 50x performance improvements while ensuring that zero-copy overhead doesn't degrade performance for small data transfers where traditional serialization is more efficient.
