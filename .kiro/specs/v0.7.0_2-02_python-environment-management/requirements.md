# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Python Environment Management system eliminates setup friction by automatically detecting and managing Python environments across different tools (UV, Poetry, Conda, venv, system Python). Currently, the "find python3" approach breaks in real deployments with complex Python setups, creating the #1 friction point for new users. This system provides intelligent environment detection, automatic dependency management, and seamless integration with existing Python workflows.

The system abstracts away Python environment complexity while maintaining full control and compatibility with existing development workflows, enabling "just works" experience across all deployment scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automatic Environment Detection

**User Story:** As a developer with an existing Python setup, I want Snakepit to automatically detect and use my Python environment, so that I don't need to manually configure Python paths or recreate my development setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Snakepit starts THEN it SHALL automatically detect the active Python environment type (UV, Poetry, Conda, venv, system)
2. WHEN multiple Python environments are available THEN the system SHALL select the most appropriate one based on project context
3. WHEN a pyproject.toml file exists THEN Poetry or UV environments SHALL be preferred over system Python
4. WHEN a conda environment is active THEN it SHALL be detected and used automatically
5. WHEN no virtual environment is detected THEN the system SHALL offer to create one automatically

### Requirement 2: UV Environment Support

**User Story:** As a developer using UV for fast Python package management, I want Snakepit to seamlessly integrate with UV environments, so that I can leverage UV's performance benefits without configuration overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UV is installed and a .python-version file exists THEN the UV-managed Python SHALL be automatically detected
2. WHEN UV virtual environments are present THEN they SHALL be discovered and activated automatically
3. WHEN UV sync is available THEN dependencies SHALL be installed using UV for optimal performance
4. WHEN UV lock files exist THEN dependency versions SHALL be respected and validated
5. WHEN UV environments are updated THEN Snakepit SHALL detect changes and reload the environment

### Requirement 3: Poetry Environment Integration

**User Story:** As a developer using Poetry for dependency management, I want Snakepit to work with Poetry virtual environments, so that my existing Poetry workflow remains unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pyproject.toml with Poetry configuration exists THEN the Poetry environment SHALL be automatically detected
2. WHEN Poetry virtual environments are created THEN they SHALL be discovered through Poetry's environment detection
3. WHEN Poetry dependencies are specified THEN they SHALL be automatically installed if missing

3. WHEN Conda environments are specified by name THEN they SHALL be activated automatically
4. WHEN Conda channels are configured THEN they SHALL be respected for package installation
5. WHEN Conda environments change THEN Snakepit SHALL detect the change and reload accordingly

### Requirement 5: Standard Virtual Environment Support

**User Story:** As a developer using standard Python venv, I want Snakepit to work with my virtual environments, so that I can use familiar Python tooling without learning new environment management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a virtual environment is activated THEN it SHALL be automatically detected through environment variables
2. WHEN venv directories are present THEN they SHALL be discovered and can be activated automatically
3. WHEN requirements.txt files exist THEN dependencies SHALL be installed using pip

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer deploying Snakepit in containers, I want automatic Python environment detection in containerized environments, so that deployment is consistent across different container platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in Docker containers THEN the Python environment SHALL be detected correctly
2. WHEN container images have pre-installed packages THEN they SHALL be discovered and used
3. WHEN Dockerfile specifies Python setup THEN the environment SHALL be configured accordingly
4. WHEN container orchestration is used THEN environment detection SHALL work consistently
5. WHEN container Python paths differ from host THEN path resolution SHALL work correctly

### Requirement 7: Dependency Management and Installation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic dependency installation and management, so that I don't need to manually install packages required by Snakepit or my Python code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Snakepit dependencies are missing THEN they SHALL be automatically installed using the detected package manager
2. WHEN user code requires additional packages THEN installation suggestions SHALL be provided
3. WHEN dependency conflicts exist THEN clear error messages SHALL explain the conflicts and suggest resolutions
4. WHEN package installation fails THEN detailed error information SHALL be provided with troubleshooting steps
5. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility and reload as needed

### Requirement 8: Environment Validation and Health Checking

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want validation that the Python environment is correctly configured and healthy, so that I can troubleshoot issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the environment is detected THEN it SHALL be validated for compatibility with Snakepit requirements
2. WHEN Python version is incompatible THEN clear upgrade instructions SHALL be provided
3. WHEN required packages are missing THEN installation commands SHALL be suggested
4. WHEN environment health checks run THEN they SHALL verify all critical dependencies are functional
5. WHEN environment issues are detected THEN diagnostic information SHALL be collected and reported

### Requirement 9: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a developer with specific environment requirements, I want to customize environment detection and management behavior, so that I can adapt Snakepit to my specific workflow needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify a preferred environment type THEN it SHALL take precedence over automatic detection
2. WHEN I configure custom Python paths THEN they SHALL be respected and validated
