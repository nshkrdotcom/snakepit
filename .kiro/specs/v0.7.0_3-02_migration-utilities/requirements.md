# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Migration Utilities system provides safe, automated, and reversible transitions between different Snakepit configurations, adapter types, and system versions. This addresses the critical need for production systems to evolve without downtime or data loss, enabling seamless upgrades from custom adapters to generic adapters, session storage migrations, and configuration changes.

The system implements comprehensive migration planning, validation, execution, and rollback capabilities with detailed progress tracking and safety mechanisms to ensure reliable production transitions.
