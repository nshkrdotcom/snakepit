# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Health Check Endpoints system provides comprehensive HTTP-based health monitoring designed for Kubernetes and cloud-native deployments. This addresses the critical need for production-ready health probes that can accurately assess Snakepit's operational status, enabling proper load balancing, auto-scaling, and failure detection in orchestrated environments.

The system implements standardized health check patterns with configurable criteria, detailed diagnostics, and integration with existing Snakepit telemetry to provide operators with reliable indicators of system health and readiness to serve traffic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Kubernetes Liveness Probe Support

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer deploying Snakepit in Kubernetes, I want reliable liveness probes that accurately detect when the application is healthy and running, so that Kubernetes can restart unhealthy pods automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `/health/live` endpoint is called THEN it SHALL return 200 OK if the BEAM VM is responsive and core services are running
2. WHEN core Snakepit processes are crashed or unresponsive THEN the liveness probe SHALL return 503 Service Unavailable
3. WHEN the application is starting up THEN the liveness probe SHALL return 503 until initialization is complete
4. WHEN the application is shutting down gracefully THEN the liveness probe SHALL return 503 to prevent new traffic
5. WHEN the liveness probe response time exceeds 30 seconds THEN it SHALL timeout and be considered failed

### Requirement 2: Kubernetes Readiness Probe Support

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want readiness probes that determine when Snakepit is ready to serve traffic, so that load balancers only route requests to fully operational instances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `/health/ready` endpoint is called THEN it SHALL return 200 OK only when all worker pools have available capacity
2. WHEN no Python workers are available THEN the readiness probe SHALL return 503 Service Unavailable
3. WHEN critical dependencies are unavailable THEN the readiness probe SHALL return 503 with dependency status
4. WHEN the system is under high load but functional THEN the readiness probe SHALL return 200 with load indicators
5. WHEN session storage is unavailable THEN the readiness probe SHALL return 503 with storage status

### Requirement 3: Kubernetes Startup Probe Support

**User Story:** As a reliability engineer, I want startup probes that handle slow application initialization, so that Kubernetes doesn't prematurely restart pods during lengthy startup processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `/health/startup` endpoint is called during initialization THEN it SHALL return 503 until all components are ready
2. WHEN Python environments are being detected and configured THEN the startup probe SHALL return 503 with initialization status
3. WHEN worker pools are being created and warmed up THEN the startup probe SHALL return 503 with progress information
4. WHEN all initialization is complete THEN the startup probe SHALL return 200 and remain healthy
5. WHEN startup takes longer than expected THEN detailed progress information SHALL be available in the response

### Requirement 4: Detailed Health Status Reporting

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed health information beyond simple pass/fail, so that I can understand system status and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `/health/detailed` endpoint is called THEN it SHALL return comprehensive system status including all components
2. WHEN individual components have issues THEN their specific status and error details SHALL be included
3. WHEN performance metrics are available THEN they SHALL be included in the detailed health response
4. WHEN dependencies are checked THEN their connectivity and response times SHALL be reported
5. WHEN the system is degraded but functional THEN the detailed status SHALL explain the degradation

### Requirement 5: Component-Specific Health Checks

**User Story:** As a monitoring engineer, I want granular health checks for individual system components, so that I can create targeted alerts and understand failure patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `/health/workers` endpoint is called THEN it SHALL return the status of all worker pools and individual workers
2. WHEN the `/health/sessions` endpoint is called THEN it SHALL return session storage health and capacity information
3. WHEN the `/health/python` endpoint is called THEN it SHALL return Python environment status and dependency health
4. WHEN the `/health/telemetry` endpoint is called THEN it SHALL return telemetry system status and metrics availability
5. WHEN individual components are queried THEN response times SHALL be under 5 seconds for operational components

### Requirement 6: Configurable Health Criteria

**User Story:** As a platform architect, I want configurable health check criteria, so that I can adapt health checks to different deployment environments and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN configuring response time thresholds THEN I SHALL be able to set maximum acceptable response times
3. WHEN configuring memory usage thresholds THEN I SHALL be able to set maximum memory usage before degraded status
4. WHEN configuring error rate thresholds THEN I SHALL be able to set maximum error rates before unhealthy status
5. WHEN health criteria are updated THEN they SHALL take effect without requiring application restart

### Requirement 7: Performance and Load Indicators

**User Story:** As a capacity planner, I want health checks to include performance and load information, so that I can make informed scaling and resource allocation decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN health checks run THEN they SHALL include current CPU and memory usage metrics
2. WHEN worker pools are under load THEN queue depths and processing times SHALL be reported
3. WHEN request rates are high THEN throughput and latency percentiles SHALL be included
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN resource utilization SHALL be clearly indicated
5. WHEN performance degrades THEN the health status SHALL reflect the degradation with specific metrics

### Requirement 8: Dependency Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As a service reliability engineer, I want health checks to validate external dependencies, so that I can detect and respond to dependency failures quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external dependencies are configured THEN their connectivity SHALL be validated in health checks
2. WHEN databases or storage systems are used THEN their response times and availability SHALL be checked
3. WHEN network services are required THEN their reachability and performance SHALL be monitored
4. WHEN dependency checks fail THEN specific error information SHALL be provided for troubleshooting
5. WHEN dependencies are slow but responsive THEN degraded status SHALL be reported with timing information

### Requirement 9: Health Check Caching and Performance

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want efficient health checks that don't impact system performance, so that frequent health check calls don't degrade application performance.
