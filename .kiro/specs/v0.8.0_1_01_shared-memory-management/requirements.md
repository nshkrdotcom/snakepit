# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Shared Memory Management System provides the foundational infrastructure for zero-copy data transfer between BEAM and Python processes in Snakepit v0.8.0. This system manages OS-level shared memory regions with cross-platform compatibility, security, and robust lifecycle management to enable high-performance data sharing without serialization overhead.

The system implements memory region allocation, mapping, synchronization, and cleanup with comprehensive safety mechanisms to prevent memory leaks, security vulnerabilities, and data corruption in production environments.

## Requirements

5. WHEN memory is mapped THEN it SHALL support both read-only and read-write access modes as specified

### Requirement 6: Concurrent Access Synchronization

**User Story:** As a concurrency specialist, I want proper synchronization for concurrent access to shared memory, so that data integrity is maintained when multiple processes access the same region.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple processes read from the same region THEN concurrent reads SHALL be safe and consistent
2. WHEN one process writes while others read THEN proper memory barriers SHALL ensure data consistency
3. WHEN multiple processes attempt to write THEN synchronization mechanisms SHALL prevent data corruption
