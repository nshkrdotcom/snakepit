# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The gRPC Protocol Extension provides seamless integration of zero-copy shared memory capabilities with Snakepit's existing gRPC communication layer. This system extends the current protocol to support shared memory references while maintaining 100% backward compatibility with existing implementations. The extension enables transparent switching between traditional serialization and zero-copy transfer based on data characteristics and performance optimization decisions.

This component acts as the integration layer that connects all v0.8.0 zero-copy subsystems (shared memory management, serialization, memory safety, and performance optimization) with the existing v0.6.0/v0.7.0 gRPC infrastructure, ensuring a unified and elegant API for users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Protocol Buffer Extension

**User Story:** As a protocol designer, I want to extend the existing Protocol Buffer definitions to support shared memory references, so that zero-copy transfers can be represented in the communication protocol.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extending protocol definitions THEN new message types SHALL be added without breaking existing message compatibility
2. WHEN shared memory references are included THEN they SHALL contain all necessary metadata (region ID, path, size, format, security tokens)
3. WHEN protocol messages are versioned THEN version negotiation SHALL ensure compatibility between different client/server versions
4. WHEN protocol extensions are used THEN they SHALL be optional and gracefully degrade to traditional serialization if not supported
5. WHEN protocol definitions change THEN automated validation SHALL ensure backward compatibility is maintained

### Requirement 2: Transparent API Integration

**User Story:** As a Snakepit user, I want the zero-copy functionality to work transparently through the existing API, so that I don't need to change my application code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling Snakepit.execute/2 THEN the system SHALL automatically choose between traditional and zero-copy transfer without API changes
2. WHEN zero-copy is used THEN the function signature and return types SHALL remain identical to traditional serialization
3. WHEN errors occur THEN error handling SHALL be consistent regardless of transfer method used
4. WHEN switching between transfer methods THEN application behavior SHALL be deterministic and predictable
5. WHEN debugging THEN telemetry SHALL clearly indicate which transfer method was used for each operation

### Requirement 3: Backward Compatibility Guarantee

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want 100% backward compatibility with existing Snakepit deployments, so that upgrades don't break production systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN v0.8.0 clients communicate with v0.7.0 servers THEN they SHALL fall back to traditional serialization automatically

5. WHEN bidirectional streaming is used THEN shared memory references SHALL work in both directions

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Fallback

**User Story:** As a reliability engineer, I want robust error handling with automatic fallback, so that zero-copy failures don't impact system availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN shared memory allocation fails THEN the system SHALL automatically fall back to traditional serialization
2. WHEN memory mapping fails THEN detailed error information SHALL be provided for debugging
3. WHEN fallback occurs THEN the operation SHALL complete successfully using traditional serialization
4. WHEN repeated failures occur THEN the system SHALL temporarily disable zero-copy and alert operators
5. WHEN fallback is used THEN telemetry SHALL track fallback frequency and reasons for analysis

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization Integration

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the protocol extension to integrate with the performance optimization system, so that transfer method decisions are data-driven.
