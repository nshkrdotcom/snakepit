# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Robust Process Management feature ensures zero orphaned processes and comprehensive worker health monitoring through BEAM-native solutions. This addresses the critical production blocker where Python workers survive BEAM crashes, leading to resource leaks and operational issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Zero Orphaned Processes

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer running Snakepit in production, I want zero orphaned Python processes after BEAM crashes, so that my systems don't experience resource leaks or require manual cleanup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the BEAM VM crashes unexpectedly (SIGKILL) THEN all Python worker processes SHALL terminate within 5 seconds
2. WHEN the BEAM VM is gracefully shut down THEN all Python workers SHALL receive SIGTERM and exit cleanly
3. WHEN a Python worker loses connection to BEAM THEN it SHALL detect the broken pipe and self-terminate immediately
4. WHEN checking for orphaned processes after BEAM restart THEN zero Python processes from the previous run SHALL remain
5. WHEN running chaos tests THEN 100% of BEAM crash scenarios SHALL result in zero orphaned processes

### Requirement 2: Heartbeat-Based Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As a site reliability engineer, I want real-time health monitoring of Python workers, so that I can detect and respond to issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a worker is healthy THEN it SHALL respond to heartbeat pings within 1 second
2. WHEN a worker fails to respond to 3 consecutive heartbeats THEN it SHALL be marked as unhealthy and restarted
3. WHEN heartbeat monitoring is active THEN it SHALL consume less than 1% of worker CPU capacity
4. WHEN configuring heartbeat intervals THEN I SHALL be able to set custom ping intervals (1-60 seconds) and timeout thresholds
5. WHEN a worker becomes unresponsive THEN the system SHALL automatically start a replacement worker

### Requirement 3: Self-Terminating Python Workers

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want Python workers to automatically detect BEAM failures and terminate themselves, so that I don't need external process management tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the stdout pipe to BEAM is broken THEN the Python worker SHALL catch BrokenPipeError and exit with code 0
2. WHEN the Python worker receives SIGTERM THEN it SHALL gracefully shut down within 3 seconds
3. WHEN the Python worker receives SIGKILL THEN any child processes SHALL be terminated via process groups
4. WHEN monitoring the BEAM process PID THEN the Python worker SHALL exit if the PID no longer exists
5. WHEN implementing signal handlers THEN they SHALL work correctly on Linux, macOS, and Windows

### Requirement 4: Optional Watchdog Process

**User Story:** As a security-conscious operator, I want an additional safety mechanism to ensure Python processes are cleaned up even in extreme failure scenarios, so that I have defense in depth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN enabling watchdog mode THEN a lightweight shell script SHALL monitor the BEAM process PID
2. WHEN the BEAM process disappears THEN the watchdog SHALL send SIGTERM to the Python worker within 1 second
3. WHEN the Python worker doesn't respond to SIGTERM THEN the watchdog SHALL send SIGKILL after 3 seconds
4. WHEN the watchdog process starts THEN it SHALL consume less than 1MB of memory and minimal CPU
5. WHEN configuring the watchdog THEN it SHALL be optional and disabled by default

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Process Lifecycle Telemetry

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want detailed telemetry for all process lifecycle events, so that I can monitor system health and debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a worker process starts THEN a telemetry event SHALL be emitted with process PID, start time, and configuration
2. WHEN heartbeat events occur THEN telemetry SHALL include latency, success/failure, and worker identification
3. WHEN a worker process terminates THEN telemetry SHALL capture exit code, reason, uptime, and cleanup duration
4. WHEN process cleanup occurs THEN events SHALL indicate whether cleanup was successful and how long it took
5. WHEN integrating with monitoring systems THEN telemetry SHALL be compatible with Prometheus, Grafana, and LiveDashboard

### Requirement 6: Graceful Shutdown and Restart

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want workers to shut down gracefully during application restarts, so that in-flight requests are handled properly and resources are cleaned up.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is shutting down THEN workers SHALL finish processing current requests before terminating
2. WHEN a worker needs to be restarted THEN it SHALL complete its current operation within a configurable timeout (default 30s)
3. WHEN graceful shutdown times out THEN the worker SHALL be forcefully terminated with SIGKILL
4. WHEN workers are restarting THEN new requests SHALL be queued or routed to healthy workers
5. WHEN shutdown is complete THEN all worker processes SHALL be confirmed terminated before application exit

### Requirement 7: Cross-Platform Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer working across different environments, I want the process management to work consistently on Linux, macOS, and Windows, so that I can develop locally and deploy to production without platform-specific issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Linux THEN all process management features SHALL work with standard signals and process groups
2. WHEN running on macOS THEN signal handling and process monitoring SHALL work identically to Linux
3. WHEN running on Windows THEN process termination SHALL use appropriate Windows APIs while maintaining the same behavior
4. WHEN using the watchdog process THEN platform-specific scripts SHALL be provided for each supported OS
5. WHEN testing cross-platform THEN automated tests SHALL verify behavior on all supported platforms

### Requirement 8: Performance and Resource Efficiency

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the process management overhead to be minimal, so that it doesn't impact the primary workload performance or resource utilization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN heartbeat monitoring is active THEN it SHALL add less than 1ms latency to worker operations
2. WHEN measuring CPU overhead THEN process management SHALL consume less than 1% of total worker CPU time
3. WHEN measuring memory overhead THEN monitoring structures SHALL use less than 1MB per worker
4. WHEN scaling to 1000+ workers THEN process management performance SHALL remain linear
5. WHEN benchmarking throughput THEN process management SHALL not reduce worker request handling capacity

### Requirement 9: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want flexible configuration options for process management, so that I can tune the behavior for my specific deployment requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring heartbeat intervals THEN I SHALL be able to set ping_interval (1-60s) and timeout_threshold (5-300s)
2. WHEN enabling watchdog mode THEN I SHALL be able to configure it per pool or globally
3. WHEN setting shutdown timeouts THEN I SHALL be able to specify graceful_shutdown_timeout (5-300s)
4. WHEN customizing telemetry THEN I SHALL be able to enable/disable specific event types
5. WHEN using environment variables THEN key settings SHALL be overrideable for containerized deployments

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a reliability engineer, I want robust error handling and automatic recovery, so that transient issues don't cause permanent failures or require manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN heartbeat communication fails temporarily THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
2. WHEN a worker crashes during startup THEN it SHALL be automatically restarted up to 3 times before marking as failed
3. WHEN process cleanup fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and attempt alternative cleanup methods
4. WHEN signal delivery fails THEN the system SHALL escalate to stronger signals (TERM â†’ KILL) automatically
5. WHEN monitoring detects anomalies THEN appropriate alerts SHALL be generated with actionable information

### Requirement 11: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing capabilities for process management, so that I can validate behavior in various failure scenarios.
