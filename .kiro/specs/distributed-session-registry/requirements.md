# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Distributed Session Registry feature enables Snakepit sessions to survive node failures and scale across multi-node BEAM clusters. Currently, sessions are stored in ETS/DETS on a single node, creating a single point of failure and preventing horizontal scaling. This feature implements a pluggable adapter architecture that maintains backward compatibility while enabling distributed session management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer deploying Snakepit in a multi-node production cluster, I want sessions to survive individual node failures, so that my applications maintain state continuity during rolling deployments and unexpected outages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a BEAM node crashes unexpectedly THEN all sessions on that node SHALL be automatically recovered on surviving nodes within 30 seconds
2. WHEN a node is gracefully shut down for maintenance THEN sessions SHALL be migrated to other nodes with zero data loss
3. WHEN the cluster is operating normally THEN session operations SHALL complete within 10ms average latency
4. WHEN a network partition occurs THEN the system SHALL continue operating with eventual consistency and no data corruption
5. WHEN nodes rejoin after a partition THEN session state SHALL be automatically reconciled without manual intervention

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an Elixir developer using Snakepit in a single-node application, I want the existing session API to work unchanged, so that I can upgrade to distributed capabilities without modifying my application code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the default configuration THEN all existing session API calls SHALL work exactly as before
2. WHEN upgrading from v0.6.0 to v0.7.0 THEN no code changes SHALL be required for single-node deployments
3. WHEN calling `Snakepit.execute_in_session/3` THEN the behavior SHALL be identical to current implementation
4. WHEN session TTL expires THEN cleanup SHALL occur automatically as it does today
5. WHEN the application starts THEN session storage SHALL initialize without additional configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform architect, I want to choose between different session storage backends based on my deployment requirements, so that I can optimize for either performance (single-node) or availability (distributed).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the session adapter THEN I SHALL be able to specify ETS, Horde, or custom implementations
2. WHEN switching adapters THEN a migration utility SHALL transfer all existing sessions without data loss
3. WHEN using ETS adapter THEN performance SHALL be identical to current implementation (<1ms latency)
4. WHEN using Horde adapter THEN sessions SHALL be distributed across all cluster nodes automatically
5. WHEN implementing a custom adapter THEN the behavior interface SHALL provide clear contracts and validation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a site reliability engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and health checks for session storage, so that I can detect and respond to issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN session operations occur THEN telemetry events SHALL be emitted with timing and success metrics
2. WHEN the session adapter experiences errors THEN structured error information SHALL be logged with correlation IDs
3. WHEN checking system health THEN a `/health/sessions` endpoint SHALL report adapter status and key metrics
4. WHEN sessions are rebalanced across nodes THEN events SHALL be emitted showing which sessions moved where
5. WHEN adapter performance degrades THEN alerts SHALL be triggered based on configurable thresholds

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want clear migration paths and tooling, so that my team can safely transition from single-node to distributed session storage in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating from ETS to Horde THEN a migration utility SHALL validate all sessions transferred correctly
2. WHEN running the migration THEN it SHALL be possible to perform the operation with zero downtime
3. WHEN migration fails THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback to the previous adapter
4. WHEN validating migration success THEN detailed reports SHALL show session counts, missing sessions, and data integrity
5. WHEN deploying to Kubernetes THEN example manifests SHALL demonstrate proper cluster configuration

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Python developer using Snakepit sessions, I want my session state to be preserved across worker restarts and node failures, so that long-running computations and cached data survive infrastructure changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Python worker crashes THEN session variables and programs SHALL remain accessible from other workers
2. WHEN session data is stored THEN it SHALL be replicated across multiple nodes for fault tolerance
3. WHEN accessing session data THEN the system SHALL automatically route to the correct node or replica
4. WHEN session TTL is configured THEN expiration SHALL be enforced consistently across all nodes
5. WHEN concurrent session updates occur THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts with last-writer-wins semantics

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the distributed session system to be self-healing and require minimal operational overhead, so that it doesn't increase the complexity of managing my Snakepit deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN nodes join the cluster THEN sessions SHALL be automatically rebalanced for optimal distribution
2. WHEN nodes leave the cluster THEN affected sessions SHALL be automatically moved to surviving nodes
3. WHEN network partitions heal THEN session state SHALL be automatically reconciled without manual intervention
4. WHEN the cluster is under high load THEN session operations SHALL gracefully degrade rather than fail
5. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL adapt without requiring restarts

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the distributed session system to scale horizontally and maintain predictable performance characteristics, so that I can plan capacity and optimize for my workload patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding nodes to the cluster THEN session capacity SHALL increase linearly with node count
2. WHEN the cluster has 10,000+ active sessions THEN individual session operations SHALL complete within 50ms
3. WHEN measuring memory usage THEN it SHALL scale predictably with session count and data size
4. WHEN benchmarking throughput THEN the system SHALL handle 1,000+ session operations per second per node
5. WHEN sessions contain large data THEN the system SHALL optimize storage and transfer efficiently
