# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Structured Error Handling & Propagation feature transforms how Snakepit handles and reports errors from Python workers. Currently, Python exceptions are often swallowed or poorly represented in Elixir, making debugging difficult and reducing operational visibility. This feature implements a comprehensive error taxonomy, structured error propagation from Python to Elixir, and correlation tracking for distributed debugging.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer debugging a failed Snakepit operation, I want to see the complete Python stack trace and error context in Elixir, so that I can quickly identify and fix the root cause without needing to dig through Python logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Python exception occurs THEN the complete Python stack trace SHALL be captured and propagated to Elixir
2. WHEN an error is returned to Elixir THEN it SHALL include the exception type, message, and full traceback
3. WHEN viewing error logs THEN Python file names, line numbers, and function names SHALL be clearly visible
4. WHEN an error occurs in nested function calls THEN the complete call stack SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN debugging in development THEN Python source code context SHALL be available around the error location

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a site reliability engineer monitoring Snakepit in production, I want structured error codes and categories, so that I can create automated alerts and dashboards based on error types and severity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be classified into standard categories (validation, execution, timeout, resource, system)
2. WHEN an error is logged THEN it SHALL include a structured error code that can be programmatically processed
3. WHEN creating alerts THEN error codes SHALL enable filtering by error type and severity level
4. WHEN analyzing trends THEN error categories SHALL be consistent across all Snakepit components
5. WHEN integrating with monitoring systems THEN error metadata SHALL be exportable in standard formats

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a distributed systems engineer, I want correlation IDs that track requests across Elixir and Python boundaries, so that I can trace the complete execution path of failed operations in multi-worker environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request enters Snakepit THEN a unique correlation ID SHALL be generated and attached to all related operations
2. WHEN an error occurs in Python THEN the correlation ID SHALL be included in the error context
3. WHEN logs are written THEN correlation IDs SHALL be consistently formatted and searchable
4. WHEN tracing distributed operations THEN correlation IDs SHALL propagate across worker boundaries
5. WHEN debugging complex workflows THEN correlation IDs SHALL enable reconstruction of the complete execution timeline

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Python developer writing Snakepit adapters, I want clear error handling patterns and utilities, so that I can properly categorize and report errors without losing important debugging information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing Python adapters THEN error handling utilities SHALL be available for common error scenarios
2. WHEN catching exceptions THEN helper functions SHALL automatically capture context and format errors consistently
3. WHEN reporting custom errors THEN the system SHALL support user-defined error codes and metadata
4. WHEN handling different exception types THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate categorization and severity mapping
5. WHEN errors occur in async code THEN stack traces and context SHALL be preserved correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an operations team member, I want error aggregation and analysis tools, so that I can identify patterns, frequent failures, and system health trends without manually parsing logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be aggregated by error code, adapter, and time window
2. WHEN viewing error reports THEN frequency, trends, and impact metrics SHALL be available
3. WHEN errors spike THEN automated detection SHALL trigger alerts with relevant context
4. WHEN analyzing system health THEN error rates SHALL be correlated with system metrics
5. WHEN planning improvements THEN error data SHALL identify the most impactful issues to address

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a client application developer, I want consistent error response formats, so that I can handle different types of failures appropriately and provide meaningful feedback to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Snakepit returns errors THEN the response format SHALL be consistent across all operation types
2. WHEN handling errors in client code THEN error types SHALL be easily distinguishable programmatically
3. WHEN displaying errors to users THEN human-readable messages SHALL be available alongside technical details
4. WHEN retrying failed operations THEN error responses SHALL indicate whether retry is appropriate
5. WHEN logging client-side errors THEN correlation IDs SHALL enable linking to server-side error details

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want error recovery and resilience features, so that transient errors don't cause unnecessary failures and the system can automatically recover from common issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transient errors occur THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with exponential backoff
2. WHEN errors are recoverable THEN clear indicators SHALL distinguish them from permanent failures
3. WHEN retry limits are exceeded THEN the final error SHALL include the complete retry history
4. WHEN circuit breakers activate THEN error responses SHALL indicate the system is in protection mode
5. WHEN systems recover THEN error rates SHALL return to normal without manual intervention

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want error handling to have minimal performance impact, so that comprehensive error reporting doesn't degrade system throughput or latency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN error processing SHALL add less than 5ms to operation latency
2. WHEN capturing stack traces THEN the overhead SHALL be negligible for successful operations
3. WHEN logging errors THEN I/O operations SHALL be asynchronous and non-blocking
4. WHEN correlating requests THEN correlation ID generation and propagation SHALL be lightweight
5. WHEN aggregating errors THEN processing SHALL not impact real-time operation performance
