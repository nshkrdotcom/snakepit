# Production-Grade Observability - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive observability system for Snakepit v0.7.0. The current telemetry implementation is insufficient for production debugging and monitoring, creating critical gaps that prevent effective operation at scale.

The observability system will provide structured telemetry, health endpoints, metrics integration, and real-time monitoring capabilities that enable operators to monitor, debug, and optimize Snakepit deployments in production environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Event Telemetry

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive telemetry events for all critical system operations, so that I can monitor system health and debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pool starts THEN the system SHALL emit a pool started event with startup time and configuration metadata
2. WHEN a pool becomes saturated THEN the system SHALL emit a pool saturated event with queue size and worker availability
3. WHEN a worker starts THEN the system SHALL emit a worker started event with startup time and worker metadata
4. WHEN a worker crashes THEN the system SHALL emit a worker crashed event with error details and stacktrace
5. WHEN a request begins execution THEN the system SHALL emit a request started event with correlation ID and command details
6. WHEN a request completes THEN the system SHALL emit a request completed event with duration and success status
7. WHEN a session is created THEN the system SHALL emit a session created event with TTL and metadata
8. WHEN sessions are cleaned up THEN the system SHALL emit a session cleanup event with count and cleanup time

### Requirement 2: Health Check Endpoints

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want HTTP health check endpoints, so that I can integrate Snakepit with load balancers and orchestration systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request /health THEN the system SHALL return 200 OK if the system is responsive
2. WHEN I request /health/ready THEN the system SHALL return 200 OK if the system can serve traffic
3. WHEN the system has no available workers THEN /health/ready SHALL return 503 Service Unavailable
4. WHEN I request /health/detailed THEN the system SHALL return comprehensive health data including pool statistics
5. WHEN health check criteria are not met THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP error codes
6. WHEN health endpoints are disabled THEN requests SHALL return 404 Not Found

### Requirement 3: Prometheus Metrics Integration

**User Story:** As a monitoring engineer, I want native Prometheus metrics integration, so that I can monitor Snakepit performance in our existing monitoring infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request /metrics THEN the system SHALL return Prometheus-formatted metrics
2. WHEN requests are processed THEN request counters SHALL be incremented with appropriate labels
3. WHEN request duration is measured THEN duration histograms SHALL be updated with timing data
4. WHEN worker state changes THEN worker gauge metrics SHALL reflect current state
5. WHEN pool queue size changes THEN queue size gauge metrics SHALL be updated
6. WHEN metrics are disabled THEN /metrics endpoint SHALL return 404 Not Found
### Requirement 4: Structured Logging System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want structured logging with correlation IDs, so that I can trace requests across the system and debug issues efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request starts THEN the system SHALL log request start with correlation ID and sanitized arguments
2. WHEN a request completes THEN the system SHALL log request completion with duration and result status
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log error details with full context and correlation ID
4. WHEN a Python exception occurs THEN the system SHALL log Python traceback with request context
5. WHEN sensitive data is present THEN the system SHALL sanitize passwords, tokens, and secrets from logs
6. WHEN log output is configured as JSON THEN all log entries SHALL be valid JSON with consistent structure

### Requirement 5: Real-time Monitoring Dashboard

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a real-time monitoring dashboard, so that I can visualize system health and performance metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the dashboard THEN I SHALL see current pool status and worker health
2. WHEN system metrics change THEN the dashboard SHALL update automatically within 1 second
3. WHEN errors occur THEN recent errors SHALL be displayed with timestamps and details
4. WHEN I view pool cards THEN I SHALL see worker availability, queue size, and request rate
5. WHEN system health changes THEN status indicators SHALL reflect current health state
6. WHEN the dashboard is disabled THEN the endpoint SHALL return 404 Not Found

### Requirement 6: Error Context Preservation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want complete error context preservation, so that I can debug Python exceptions and system failures effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Python exception occurs THEN the system SHALL capture the full Python traceback
2. WHEN a gRPC error occurs THEN the system SHALL capture gRPC status codes and error details
3. WHEN a worker crashes THEN the system SHALL capture crash reason and system context
4. WHEN an error is logged THEN the system SHALL include correlation ID and request context
5. WHEN errors are sanitized THEN sensitive data SHALL be removed while preserving debug information
6. WHEN error rates exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL emit appropriate telemetry events

### Requirement 7: Performance Monitoring

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want detailed performance metrics, so that I can optimize system performance and capacity planning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests are processed THEN request duration SHALL be measured and recorded
2. WHEN workers are utilized THEN worker utilization metrics SHALL be tracked
3. WHEN queues build up THEN queue depth and wait times SHALL be monitored
4. WHEN memory usage changes THEN system memory metrics SHALL be updated
5. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN appropriate alerts SHALL be generated
6. WHEN performance data is requested THEN metrics SHALL include percentiles and histograms

### Requirement 8: Configuration and Control

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want configurable observability features, so that I can control overhead and adapt to different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN observability is disabled THEN the system SHALL operate with minimal overhead
2. WHEN sampling rates are configured THEN high-volume events SHALL be sampled accordingly
3. WHEN log levels are set THEN only appropriate log entries SHALL be emitted
4. WHEN health check criteria are configured THEN health endpoints SHALL use custom thresholds
5. WHEN metrics are customized THEN additional application-specific metrics SHALL be supported
6. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL apply changes without restart when possible
