# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Chaos Testing Framework provides comprehensive automated testing of Snakepit's behavior under catastrophic failure conditions. This addresses the critical gap in current testing where timing-dependent integration tests fail to validate real-world production scenarios like BEAM crashes, network partitions, and resource exhaustion.

The framework implements systematic chaos engineering principles to ensure Snakepit maintains its reliability guarantees (zero orphaned processes, session persistence, graceful degradation) under extreme conditions that occur in production deployments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: BEAM Process Failure Testing

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated testing of BEAM VM crashes, so that I can verify zero orphaned processes and proper cleanup in production failure scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the BEAM VM is killed with SIGKILL THEN all Python worker processes SHALL terminate within 5 seconds
2. WHEN BEAM crashes during active request processing THEN no Python processes SHALL remain orphaned after cleanup
3. WHEN BEAM restarts after a crash THEN the system SHALL recover to full functionality within 30 seconds
4. WHEN multiple BEAM crashes occur in sequence THEN each crash SHALL result in 100% process cleanup success
5. WHEN BEAM crashes are simulated 1000+ times THEN the orphaned process rate SHALL be 0.0%

### Requirement 2: Network Partition and Communication Failure Testing

**User Story:** As a distributed systems engineer, I want automated testing of network failures, so that I can validate Snakepit's behavior when communication between components is disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network communication between BEAM and Python workers is severed THEN Python workers SHALL self-terminate within 10 seconds
2. WHEN gRPC connections are forcibly closed THEN workers SHALL detect the failure and restart automatically
3. WHEN network partitions occur in multi-node deployments THEN session state SHALL remain consistent
4. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically recover without manual intervention
5. WHEN simulating various network failure patterns THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity in 100% of scenarios

### Requirement 3: Resource Exhaustion Testing

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want automated testing under resource constraints, so that I can validate graceful degradation and recovery behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system memory is exhausted THEN Snakepit SHALL reject new requests gracefully rather than crash
2. WHEN CPU usage reaches 100% THEN the system SHALL continue processing existing requests with degraded performance
3. WHEN disk space is exhausted THEN session persistence SHALL fail gracefully with appropriate error messages
4. WHEN file descriptor limits are reached THEN new worker creation SHALL be throttled appropriately
5. WHEN resources are restored THEN the system SHALL automatically resume normal operation

### Requirement 4: Concurrent Failure Scenario Testing

**User Story:** As a reliability engineer, I want testing of multiple simultaneous failures, so that I can validate system behavior under compound failure conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN BEAM crashes occur simultaneously with network partitions THEN cleanup SHALL still achieve 100% success rate
2. WHEN resource exhaustion occurs during worker restarts THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical operations
3. WHEN multiple workers fail concurrently THEN session state SHALL remain consistent across all scenarios
4. WHEN cascading failures occur THEN the system SHALL prevent complete system collapse through circuit breakers
5. WHEN recovery begins from compound failures THEN the system SHALL restore functionality in a predictable order

### Requirement 5: Session Persistence and State Consistency Testing

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want validation that session state survives chaos scenarios, so that I can rely on session persistence guarantees in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chaos events occur during active sessions THEN session data SHALL remain accessible after recovery
2. WHEN distributed session adapters are used THEN session consistency SHALL be maintained across node failures
3. WHEN session operations are in progress during failures THEN partial updates SHALL be handled consistently
4. WHEN multiple session adapters are tested THEN each SHALL maintain consistency guarantees under chaos
5. WHEN session TTL expires during chaos events THEN cleanup SHALL occur correctly after system recovery

### Requirement 6: Worker Lifecycle and Pool Management Testing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want validation of worker and pool behavior under failure conditions, so that I can trust the system's self-healing capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workers crash during chaos events THEN pools SHALL automatically replace failed workers
2. WHEN entire pools become unavailable THEN the system SHALL route requests to healthy pools
3. WHEN worker profiles change during failures THEN the system SHALL maintain configuration consistency
4. WHEN pool saturation occurs during recovery THEN backpressure mechanisms SHALL prevent system overload
5. WHEN worker recycling happens during chaos THEN no requests SHALL be lost or corrupted

### Requirement 7: Telemetry and Observability Under Chaos

**User Story:** As a monitoring engineer, I want validation that observability systems continue functioning during failures, so that I can maintain visibility during production incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chaos events occur THEN telemetry events SHALL continue to be emitted accurately
2. WHEN monitoring systems are under stress THEN critical metrics SHALL still be collected and reported
3. WHEN log aggregation is disrupted THEN local logging SHALL continue to capture essential events
4. WHEN health check endpoints are tested during failures THEN they SHALL accurately reflect system state
5. WHEN alerting systems are triggered THEN notifications SHALL be sent with correct severity and context

### Requirement 8: Configuration and Environment Variation Testing

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want chaos testing across different configurations, so that I can validate robustness across various deployment scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing different WorkerProfile configurations THEN chaos behavior SHALL be consistent across profiles
2. WHEN testing various pool sizes and configurations THEN failure patterns SHALL be predictable
3. WHEN testing different Python environments THEN chaos recovery SHALL work uniformly
4. WHEN testing single-node vs multi-node deployments THEN failure handling SHALL be appropriate for each
5. WHEN testing different session adapter configurations THEN chaos resilience SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 9: Automated Test Execution and CI Integration

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want automated chaos testing in CI/CD pipelines, so that regressions in failure handling are caught before production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chaos tests run in CI THEN they SHALL complete within 30 minutes for the full suite
2. WHEN chaos tests fail THEN detailed failure reports SHALL be generated with reproduction steps
3. WHEN running nightly chaos tests THEN comprehensive scenarios SHALL be executed automatically
4. WHEN chaos tests are triggered manually THEN specific failure scenarios SHALL be selectable
5. WHEN integrating with existing test suites THEN chaos tests SHALL not interfere with other test execution

### Requirement 10: Chaos Test Reporting and Analysis

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want detailed reporting of chaos test results, so that I can analyze failure patterns and validate system improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chaos tests complete THEN detailed reports SHALL include success rates, failure modes, and timing data
2. WHEN failures occur THEN root cause analysis information SHALL be captured automatically
3. WHEN comparing test runs THEN trend analysis SHALL show improvement or degradation over time
4. WHEN generating reports THEN they SHALL be suitable for both technical teams and management review
5. WHEN archiving test results THEN historical data SHALL be preserved for long-term analysis

### Requirement 11: Chaos Test Configuration and Customization

3. WHEN optimizing test execution THEN overhead SHALL be minimized while maintaining test effectiveness
4. WHEN running production-like loads THEN chaos testing SHALL not significantly degrade normal operations
