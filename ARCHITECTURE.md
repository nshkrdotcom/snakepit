# Snakepit Architecture  
_Captured for v0.6.0 (worker profiles & heartbeat workstream)_  

## Overview

Snakepit is an OTP application that brokers Python execution over gRPC. The BEAM side owns lifecycle, state, and health; Python workers stay stateless, disposable, and protocol-focused. Version 0.6.0 introduces dual worker profiles (process vs. thread), proactive recycling, and heartbeat-driven supervision, so the documentation below reflects the current tree.

Python processes are launched by each GRPCWorker and connect back to the BEAM gRPC endpoint for stateful operations (sessions, variables, telemetry).

## Control Plane Components (Elixir)

### `Snakepit.Application`
- Applies Python thread limits before the tree boots (prevents fork bombs with large pools).
- Starts base services, optionally the pooling branch, and records start/stop timestamps for diagnostics.

### `Snakepit.Bridge.SessionStore` (`lib/snakepit/bridge/session_store.ex`)
- GenServer + ETS pair that owns all stateful session data.
- ETS tables (`:snakepit_sessions`, `:snakepit_sessions_global_programs`) are created with read/write concurrency and decentralized counters.
- Provides TTL expiration, atomic operations, and selective cleanup for high churn pools.

### `Snakepit.Bridge.ToolRegistry`
- Tracks registered tools/adapters exposed to Python workers.
- Keeps metadata so GRPCWorker can answer `Describe` calls without touching disk.

### `Snakepit.GRPC.Endpoint`
- Cowboy-based endpoint that Python workers call for session/variable RPCs.
- Runs under `GRPC.Server.Supervisor` with tuned acceptor/backlog values to survive 200+ concurrent worker startups.

### Registries (`Snakepit.Pool.Registry`, `Snakepit.Pool.ProcessRegistry`, `Snakepit.Pool.Worker.StarterRegistry`)
- Provide O(1) lookup for worker routing, track external OS PIDs/run IDs, and ensure cleanup routines can map resources back to the current BEAM instance.
- `ProcessRegistry` uses ETS to store run IDs so `Snakepit.ProcessKiller` and `Snakepit.Pool.ApplicationCleanup` can reap orphans deterministically.

### `Snakepit.Pool`
- GenServer request router with queueing, session affinity, and Task.Supervisor integration.
- Starts workers concurrently on boot using async streams; runtime execution uses `Task.Supervisor.async_nolink/2` so the pool remains non-blocking.
- Emits telemetry per request lifecycle; integrates with `Snakepit.Worker.LifecycleManager` for request-count tracking.

### `Snakepit.Worker.LifecycleManager`
- Tracks worker TTLs, request counts, and optional memory thresholds.
- Monitors worker pids and triggers graceful recycling via the pool when budgets are exceeded.
- Coordinates periodic health checks across the pool and emits telemetry (`[:snakepit, :worker, :recycled]`, etc.) for dashboards.

### `Snakepit.Pool.ApplicationCleanup`
- Last child in the pool branch; terminates first on shutdown.
- Uses `Snakepit.ProcessKiller` to terminate lingering Python processes based on recorded run IDs.
- Ensures the BEAM exits cleanly even if upstream supervisors crash.

## Execution Capsule (Per Worker)

### `Snakepit.Pool.WorkerStarter`
- Permanent supervisor that owns a transient worker.
- Provides a hook to extend the capsule with additional children (profilers, monitors, etc.).
- Makes restarts local: killing the starter tears down the worker, heartbeat monitor, and any profile-specific state atomically.

### Worker profiles (`Snakepit.WorkerProfile.*`)
- Abstract the strategy for request capacity:
  - `Process` profile: one request per Python process (`capacity = 1`).
  - `Thread` profile: multi-request concurrency inside a single Python process.
- Profiles decide how to spawn/stop workers and how to report health/capacity back to the pool.

### `Snakepit.GRPCWorker`
- GenServer that launches the Python gRPC server, manages the Port, and bridges execute/stream calls.
- Maintains worker metadata (run ID, OS PID, adapter options) and cooperates with LifecycleManager/HeartbeatMonitor for health.
- Interacts with registries for lookup and with `Snakepit.ProcessKiller` for escalation on shutdown.

### `Snakepit.HeartbeatMonitor`
- Optional GenServer started per worker based on pool configuration.
- Periodically invokes a ping callback (usually a gRPC health RPC) and tracks missed responses.
- Signals the WorkerStarter (by exiting the worker) when thresholds are breached, allowing the supervisor to restart the capsule.

### `Snakepit.ProcessKiller`
- Utility module for POSIX-compliant termination of external processes.
- Provides `kill_with_escalation/1` semantics (SIGTERM → SIGKILL) and discovery helpers (`kill_by_run_id/1`).
- Used by ApplicationCleanup, LifecycleManager, and GRPCWorker terminate callbacks.

## Python Bridge

- `priv/python/grpc_server.py`: Stateless gRPC service that exposes Snakepit functionality to user adapters. It forwards session operations to Elixir and defers telemetry to the BEAM.
- `priv/python/snakepit_bridge/session_context.py`: Client helper that caches variables locally with TTL invalidation and knows how to signal heartbeats back to Elixir (in progress for the heartbeat workstream).
- `priv/python/snakepit_bridge/adapters/*`: User-defined logic; receives a `SessionContext` and uses generated stubs from `snakepit_bridge.proto`.
- Python code is bundled with the release; regeneration happens via `make proto-python` or `priv/python/generate_grpc.sh`.

## Observability & Telemetry

- `Snakepit.Telemetry` defines events for worker lifecycle, pool throughput, queue depth, and heartbeat outcomes. `Snakepit.TelemetryMetrics.metrics/0` feeds Prometheus via `TelemetryMetricsPrometheus.Core` once `config :snakepit, telemetry_metrics: %{prometheus: %{enabled: true}}` is set. By default metrics remain disabled so unit tests can run without a reporter.
- `Snakepit.Telemetry.OpenTelemetry` boots spans when `config :snakepit, opentelemetry: %{enabled: true}`. Local developers typically enable the console exporter (`export SNAKEPIT_OTEL_CONSOLE=true`) while CI and production point `SNAKEPIT_OTEL_ENDPOINT` at an OTLP collector. The Elixir configuration honours exporter toggles (`:otlp`, `:console`) and resource attributes (`service.name`, etc.).
- Correlation IDs flow through `lib/snakepit/telemetry/correlation.ex` and are injected into gRPC metadata. The Python bridge reads the `x-snakepit-correlation-id` header, sets the active span when `opentelemetry-sdk` is available, and mirrors the ID into structured logs so traces and logs line up across languages.
- Python workers inherit the interpreter from `Snakepit.Adapters.GRPCPython.executable_path/0`. Set `SNAKEPIT_PYTHON=$PWD/.venv/bin/python3` (or add the path to `config/test.exs`) so CI/dev shells use the virtualenv that contains `grpcio`, `opentelemetry-*`, and `pytest`. `PYTHONPATH=priv/python` keeps the bridge packages importable for pytest and for the runtime shims.
- Validation recipe:
  1. `mix test --color --trace` – asserts Elixir spans/metrics handlers attach and that worker start-up succeeds with OTEL deps present.
  2. `PYTHONPATH=priv/python .venv/bin/pytest priv/python/tests -q` – exercises span helpers, correlation filters, and the threaded bridge parity tests.
  3. (Optional) `curl http://localhost:9568/metrics` – once Prometheus is enabled, confirms heartbeat counters and pool gauges surface to `/metrics`.

## Design Principles (Current)

1. **Stateless Python Workers** – All durable state lives in `Snakepit.Bridge.SessionStore`; Python can be restarted at will.
2. **Layered Supervision** – Control-plane supervisors manage pools and registries, while WorkerStarter encapsulates per-worker processes.
3. **Config-Driven Behaviour** – Pooling can be disabled (tests), heartbeat tuning lives in config maps, and worker profiles are pluggable.
4. **Proactive Health Management** – Heartbeats, lifecycle recycling, and deterministic kill routines keep long-running clusters stable.
5. **O(1) Routing & Concurrency** – Registries and ETS deliver constant-time lookup so the pool stays responsive at high request volume.

## Worker Lifecycle (Happy Path)

1. Pool boot requests `size` workers from `WorkerSupervisor`.
2. `WorkerStarter` launches the configured profile and creates a GRPCWorker.
3. GRPCWorker spawns the Python process, registers with registries, and (optionally) starts a HeartbeatMonitor.
4. LifecycleManager begins tracking TTL/request budgets.
5. Requests flow: `Snakepit.Pool` → `Task.Supervisor` → GRPCWorker → Python.
6. Completion events increment lifecycle counters; heartbeats maintain health status.
7. Recycling or heartbeat failures call back into the pool to spin up a fresh capsule.

## Protocol Overview

- gRPC definitions live in `priv/proto/snakepit_bridge.proto`.
- Core RPCs: `Execute`, `ExecuteStream`, `RegisterTool`, `GetVariable`, `SetVariable`, `InitializeSession`, `CleanupSession`, `GetWorkerInfo`, `Heartbeat`.
- Binary fields are used for large payloads; Elixir encodes via ETF and Python falls back to pickle.
- Generated code is versioned in `lib/snakepit/grpc/generated/` (Elixir) and `priv/python/generated/` (Python).

## Operational Notes

- Toggle `:pooling_enabled` for integration tests or single-worker scenarios.
- Dialyzer PLTs live in `priv/plts`—run `mix dialyzer` after changing protocol or worker APIs.
- When introducing new supervisor children, update `lib/snakepit/supervisor_tree.md` and corresponding docs in `docs/20251018/`.
- Always regenerate gRPC stubs in lockstep (`mix grpc.gen`, `make proto-python`) before cutting a release.
