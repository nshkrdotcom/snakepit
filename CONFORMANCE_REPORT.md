# Snakepit Conformance Report

## Summary
This report documents the work completed to ensure Snakepit conforms to the three-layer architecture vision and is ready for integration with SnakepitGRPCBridge.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Architecture Review
- Reviewed all 16 specification documents in `docs/specs/threeLayerRevised/`
- Confirmed three-layer architecture:
  - **Snakepit**: Pure infrastructure layer (no Python code)
  - **SnakepitGRPCBridge**: ML platform layer (contains all Python code)
  - **DSPex**: Thin orchestration layer

### 2. Adapter Contract Tests
Created comprehensive test suite for the Snakepit.Adapter behavior:
- `/snakepit/test/snakepit/adapter_contract_test.exs`
- Tests validate:
  - Required callback: `execute/3`
  - Optional callbacks: `init/1`, `terminate/2`, `start_worker/2`, `supports_streaming?/0`, `execute_stream/4`, `get_cognitive_metadata/0`, `report_performance_metrics/2`
  - Adapter validation functionality
  - Cognitive metadata structure

### 3. Process Management Tests
Created tests for core process management capabilities:
- `/snakepit/test/snakepit/process_management_test.exs`
- Tests cover:
  - Process lifecycle tracking
  - Orphan prevention via BEAM run ID
  - Worker crash recovery
  - Graceful shutdown
  - DETS persistence concept

### 4. Example Files
Created four comprehensive examples demonstrating Snakepit usage:

#### `examples/01_basic_adapter.exs`
- Minimal adapter implementation
- Shows only required `execute/3` callback
- Demonstrates pooling benefits without external dependencies

#### `examples/02_full_adapter.exs`
- Complete adapter with all optional callbacks
- Shows lifecycle management, streaming, cognitive metadata
- Demonstrates advanced features

#### `examples/03_session_affinity.exs`
- Session-based request routing
- Stateful operations with worker affinity
- Shows how to maintain context across requests

#### `examples/04_bridge_integration.exs`
- Mock implementation showing bridge integration pattern
- Demonstrates separation of concerns between layers
- Shows how SnakepitGRPCBridge.Adapter would integrate

### 5. Documentation Updates
- Added inline documentation to examples explaining key concepts
- Documented the adapter contract and its purpose
- Clarified the separation between infrastructure and platform layers

## Key Findings

### 1. Configuration Issues
- Dev config was referencing non-existent `Snakepit.Adapters.GRPCPython`
- Fixed to use `Snakepit.TestAdapters.MockAdapter` for testing
- Real adapter (`SnakepitGRPCBridge.Adapter`) lives in bridge layer

### 2. Test Infrastructure
- Mock adapters had invalid `uses_grpc?` callback not in behavior
- ProcessRegistry tests were using wrong function names
- Fixed all test infrastructure issues

### 3. Architecture Validation
- Confirmed Snakepit is architecturally pure (no Python in `/priv`)
- All Python code correctly consolidated in bridge layer
- Clear separation of concerns achieved

## Adapter Contract Summary

The Snakepit.Adapter behavior defines the contract between layers:

### Required Callback
- `execute(command, args, opts)` - Execute a command synchronously

### Optional Callbacks
- `init(config)` - Initialize adapter state
- `terminate(reason, state)` - Clean up on shutdown
- `start_worker(adapter_state, worker_id)` - Start external worker process
- `supports_streaming?()` - Declare streaming support
- `execute_stream(command, args, stream_callback, opts)` - Execute with streaming
- `get_cognitive_metadata()` - Provide adapter capabilities
- `report_performance_metrics(timing, metadata)` - Report performance data

## Next Steps

1. **Bridge Integration**
   - Implement `SnakepitGRPCBridge.Adapter` in bridge layer
   - Connect Python processes via gRPC
   - Implement bidirectional tool bridge

2. **Testing**
   - Run full integration tests with bridge
   - Verify process management with real Python workers
   - Test orphan cleanup in production scenarios

3. **Documentation**
   - Create developer guide for writing adapters
   - Document deployment patterns
   - Add troubleshooting guide

## Conclusion

Snakepit is architecturally sound and ready for integration. The adapter contract is well-defined, tests are comprehensive, and examples demonstrate all key patterns. The separation between infrastructure (Snakepit) and platform (SnakepitGRPCBridge) layers is clean and maintainable.
