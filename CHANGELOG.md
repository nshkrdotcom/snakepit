## [0.5.1] - 2025-10-11

### Added
- **Diagnostic Tools**
  - New `mix diagnose.scaling` task (613 lines) for comprehensive bottleneck analysis
  - Captures resource metrics (ports, processes, TCP connections, memory usage)
  - Enhanced error logging with port buffer drainage

- **Configuration Enhancements**
  - Explicit gRPC port range constraint documentation and validation
  - Batched worker startup configuration (`startup_batch_size: 8`, `startup_batch_delay_ms: 750`)
  - Resource limit safeguards with `max_workers: 1000` hard limit

### Changed
- **Worker Pool Scaling Improvements**
  - Pool now reliably scales to 250+ workers (previously limited to ~105)
  - Resolved thread explosion during concurrent startup (fixed "fork bomb" issue)
  - Dynamic port allocation using OS-assigned ports (port=0) eliminates port collision races
  - Batched worker startup prevents system resource exhaustion during concurrent initialization

- **Performance Optimizations**
  - Aggressive thread limiting via environment variables for optimal pool-level parallelism:
    - `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1` (numpy/scipy)
    - `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` (OpenMP)
    - `MKL_NUM_THREADS=1` (Intel MKL)
    - `NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=1` (NumExpr)
    - `GRPC_POLL_STRATEGY=poll` (single-threaded)
  - Increased GRPC server connection backlog to 512
  - Extended worker ready timeout to 30s for large pools

- **Configuration Updates**
  - Increased `port_range` to 1000 (accommodates `max_workers`)
  - Enhanced configuration comments explaining each tuning parameter
  - Resource usage tracking during pool initialization

### Fixed
- **Concurrent Startup Issues**
  - Fixed "Cannot fork" / EAGAIN errors from thread explosion during worker spawn
  - Eliminated port collision races with dynamic port allocation
  - Resolved fork bomb caused by Python scientific libraries spawning excessive threads (6,000+ threads from OpenBLAS, gRPC, MKL)

- **Resource Management**
  - Better port binding error handling in Python gRPC server
  - Improved error diagnostics during pool initialization
  - Enhanced connection management in GRPC server

### Performance
- Successfully tested with 250 workers (2.5x previous limit)
- Startup time increases with pool size (~60s for 250 workers vs ~10s for 100 workers)
- Eliminated port collision races and fork resource exhaustion
- Dynamic port allocation provides reliable scaling

### Notes
- Thread limiting optimizes for high concurrency with many small tasks
- CPU-intensive workloads that perform heavy numerical computation within a single task may need different threading configuration
- For computationally intensive per-task workloads, consider:
  - Workload-specific environment variables passed per task
  - Separate worker pools with different threading profiles
  - Dynamic thread limit adjustment based on task type
  - Allowing higher OpenBLAS threads but reducing max_workers accordingly
- See commit dc67572 for detailed technical analysis and future considerations
