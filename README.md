# Snakepit

A high-performance, generalized pooler and session manager.

## Overview

Snakepit provides:

- **Concurrent worker initialization** - All workers start in parallel using `Task.async_stream`
- **High-performance OTP-based process management** - Built on DynamicSupervisor, Registry, and GenServer
- **Stateless pool system** - Workers are stateless; all session data lives in centralized SessionStore
- **Session affinity** - Support for session-based execution with automatic worker affinity
- **Generalized adapter pattern** - Designed to support multiple ML frameworks beyond just Python/DSPy
- **Process tracking and cleanup** - Robust process lifecycle management with automatic cleanup

## Architecture

The V3 pool design abandons complex pool libraries in favor of simple OTP patterns:

1. **Worker Supervisor (DynamicSupervisor)** - Manages worker lifecycle with automatic restarts
2. **Individual Workers (GenServer)** - Each worker owns one external process via Port
3. **Pool Manager (GenServer)** - Simple queue-based request distribution
4. **Registry** - Named process registration for O(1) worker lookup
5. **SessionStore** - Centralized ETS-based session management

## Performance

Key performance improvements over traditional pooling approaches:

- **1000x+ faster startup** - Concurrent initialization vs sequential
- **Simple codebase** - ~300 lines of core code vs ~2000 lines in complex pool libraries
- **OTP reliability** - Battle-tested supervision trees handle failures automatically
- **Clustering ready** - Registry pattern enables easy distribution

## Basic Usage

```elixir
# Configure and start
Application.put_env(:snakepit, :pooling_enabled, true)
Application.put_env(:snakepit, :pool_config, %{pool_size: 4})

{:ok, _} = Application.ensure_all_started(:snakepit)

# Execute commands
{:ok, result} = Snakepit.execute("ping", %{test: true})

# Session-based execution  
{:ok, result} = Snakepit.execute_in_session("my_session", "command", %{})

# Get pool statistics
stats = Snakepit.get_stats()
```

## Running the Demo

```bash
# Generic functionality demo
elixir examples/generic_demo.exs
```

## Configuration

```elixir
config :snakepit,
  pooling_enabled: true,
  pool_config: %{
    pool_size: 8  # Default: System.schedulers_online() * 2
  }
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Fast Startup**: All workers initialize concurrently
2. **Simple Code**: Standard OTP patterns, no magic
3. **OTP Reliability**: Automatic supervision and restart handling  
4. **Clustering Ready**: Registry pattern enables distribution
5. **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns

## Development Status

This is an extraction of the proven DSPex V3 pool implementation, which achieved:

- 1000x+ performance improvements through concurrent initialization
- Production stability with comprehensive error handling
- Clean separation between pooling and ML framework logic
- Extensible adapter pattern for multiple frameworks

## Future Extensions

The design supports easy evolution:

1. **Multiple Adapters** - JavaScript, R, or other language integrations
2. **Clustering** - Replace Registry with Horde.Registry for distribution  
3. **Advanced Metrics** - Telemetry events for monitoring
4. **Load Balancing** - Cross-pool request distribution
5. **Dynamic Scaling** - Automatic pool size adjustment

## Installation

Add `snakepit` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:snakepit, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
