defmodule Snakepit do
  @moduledoc """
  Snakepit - A generalized high-performance pooler and session manager.

  Extracted from DSPex V3 pool implementation, Snakepit provides:
  - Concurrent worker initialization and management
  - Stateless pool system with session affinity 
  - Generalized adapter pattern for any external process
  - High-performance OTP-based process management

  ## Basic Usage

      # Configure in config/config.exs
      config :snakepit,
        pooling_enabled: true,
        adapter_module: YourAdapter

      # Execute commands on any available worker
      {:ok, result} = Snakepit.execute("ping", %{test: true})
      
      # Session-based execution with worker affinity
      {:ok, result} = Snakepit.execute_in_session("my_session", "command", %{})

  ## Domain-Specific Helpers

  For ML/DSP workflows with program management, see `Snakepit.SessionHelpers`:

      # ML program creation and execution
      {:ok, result} = Snakepit.SessionHelpers.execute_program_command(
        "session_id", "create_program", %{signature: "input -> output"}
      )

  @doc """
  Convenience function to execute commands on the pool.
  """
  def execute(command, args, opts \\ []) do
    Snakepit.Pool.execute(command, args, opts)
  end

  @doc """
  Executes a command in session context with worker affinity.

  This function executes commands with session-based worker affinity,
  ensuring that subsequent calls with the same session_id prefer
  the same worker when possible for state continuity.

  Args are passed through unchanged - no domain-specific enhancement.
  For ML/DSP program workflows, use `Snakepit.SessionHelpers.execute_program_command/4`.

  def execute_in_session(session_id, command, args, opts \\ []) do
    # Add session_id to opts for session affinity
    opts_with_session = Keyword.put(opts, :session_id, session_id)

    # Execute command with session affinity (no args enhancement)
    execute(command, args, opts_with_session)
