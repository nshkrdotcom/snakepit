● Comprehensive Plan for Removing Legacy stdin/stdout Communication

  Based on my analysis, the gRPC system has full feature parity and is ready to completely replace the legacy system. Here's the detailed plan:

  Phase 1: Pre-Migration Validation (Safety First)

  1. Create Migration Branch
  git checkout -b feature/remove-legacy-stdin-stdout
  2. Run Full Test Suite with gRPC-Only Configuration
    - Temporarily update all configs to use Snakepit.Adapters.GRPCPython
    - Run full test suite to identify any tests that fail
    - Document any integration points that need updating
  3. Audit Application Entry Points
    - Search for direct usage of legacy adapters in application code
    - Identify any code using Snakepit.execute/2 instead of modern APIs
    - Check for hardcoded adapter references

  Phase 2: Configuration Updates

  1. Update Configuration Files
    - Remove :wire_protocol settings
    - Remove adapter-specific configurations for legacy adapters
    - Set adapter_module: Snakepit.Adapters.GRPCPython as default
    - Remove MessagePack-specific settings
  2. Remove Dependencies
    - Remove :msgpax from mix.exs
    - Remove msgpack from Python requirements.txt
    - Delete requirements-msgpack.txt

  Phase 3: Legacy Code Removal - Elixir

  1. Delete Core Protocol Components
  rm lib/snakepit/bridge/protocol.ex
  rm lib/snakepit/pool/worker.ex
  2. Delete Legacy Adapters
  rm lib/snakepit/adapters/generic_python.ex
  rm lib/snakepit/adapters/generic_python_v2.ex
  rm lib/snakepit/adapters/generic_python_msgpack.ex
  rm lib/snakepit/adapters/generic_javascript.ex
  rm lib/snakepit/adapters/enhanced_python.ex
  3. Delete Session Helpers (if program-centric)
  rm lib/snakepit/session_helpers.ex  # Verify it's not used by gRPC

  Phase 4: Legacy Code Removal - Python

  1. Delete Bridge Entry Points
  rm priv/python/generic_bridge.py
  rm priv/python/generic_bridge_v2.py
  rm priv/python/enhanced_bridge.py
  rm priv/python/example_custom_bridge.py
  rm priv/python/example_custom_bridge_v2.py
  2. Delete Core Protocol Handler
  rm priv/python/snakepit_bridge/core.py
  3. Delete Legacy Adapters
  rm priv/python/snakepit_bridge/adapters/generic.py
  rm priv/python/snakepit_bridge/adapters/dspy_grpc.py  # If stateful

  Phase 5: Legacy Code Removal - JavaScript

  1. Delete JavaScript Bridge
  rm priv/javascript/generic_bridge.js

  Phase 6: Test Updates

  1. Delete Legacy-Specific Tests
  rm test/msgpack_protocol_test.exs
  rm test/protocol_negotiation_test.exs
  rm test/snakepit/adapters/generic_python_v2_test.exs
  rm test/snakepit/adapters/enhanced_python_test.exs
  2. Update Integration Tests
    - Rewrite any tests that specifically test legacy adapters
    - Ensure all tests use gRPC adapters

  Phase 7: Code Refactoring

  1. Simplify Utils Module
    - Remove determine_worker_module/1 function
    - Update all callers to use Snakepit.GRPCWorker directly
  2. Update Adapter Behaviour
    - Refactor Snakepit.Adapter to remove Port-specific callbacks
    - Create new Snakepit.GRPC.Adapter behaviour if needed
  3. Clean Pool Logic
    - Remove conditional checks for worker types
    - Simplify timeout handling
  4. Update Python Adapter Base
    - Remove inheritance from deleted BaseCommandHandler
    - Establish new base class for gRPC adapters

  Phase 8: Documentation Updates

  1. Update README.md
    - Remove all references to stdin/stdout protocol
    - Remove MessagePack/JSON protocol documentation
    - Update examples to use gRPC exclusively
  2. Update Module Documentation
    - Remove @moduledoc references to legacy protocols
    - Update architecture diagrams
  3. Update Examples
  rm examples/*_msgpack.exs
  # Update remaining examples to use gRPC

  Phase 9: Final Cleanup

  1. Run Static Analysis
  mix deps.get
  mix compile --warnings-as-errors
  mix dialyzer
  mix credo --strict
  2. Run Python Linting
  cd priv/python
  flake8 .
  mypy .
  3. Search for Orphaned References
    - Search for "msgpack", "wire_protocol", "Port"
    - Search for references to deleted modules

  Phase 10: Verification

  1. Run Complete Test Suite
  mix test
  2. Run Integration Tests
    - Test all major use cases with gRPC
    - Verify session management works
    - Verify variable management works
  3. Performance Testing
    - Compare gRPC performance with legacy baseline
    - Ensure no regression in throughput

  Execution Order

  1. Day 1: Phases 1-2 (Validation & Configuration)
  2. Day 2: Phases 3-6 (Code Removal)
  3. Day 3: Phases 7-8 (Refactoring & Documentation)
  4. Day 4: Phases 9-10 (Cleanup & Verification)

  Rollback Plan

  If issues are discovered:
  1. Keep the feature branch separate until fully tested
  2. Can revert configuration changes to re-enable legacy adapters
  3. Git history preserves all deleted code for reference

  Success Criteria

  - ✅ All tests pass with gRPC-only configuration
  - ✅ No references to legacy protocols remain
  - ✅ Documentation reflects gRPC-only architecture
  - ✅ Performance meets or exceeds legacy system
  - ✅ Clean static analysis results
