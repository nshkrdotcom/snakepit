# ADR 001: Worker.Starter Supervision Pattern

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Deciders**: nshkrdotcom
**Context**: Issue #2 feedback questioning supervision layer complexity

---

## Context and Problem Statement

Snakepit workers manage external OS processes (Python gRPC servers). We need to handle:
- Worker crashes and automatic restarts
- Clean resource cleanup (ports, file descriptors, child processes)
- Future potential for per-worker resource pooling (connections, caches)

**The Question** (from Issue #2):
> "What does having a :temporary worker under a Supervisor, which itself is under a DynamicSupervisor bring us (that it's worth the extra layer of complexity)?"

---

## Decision Drivers

1. **External Process Management** - Workers spawn and manage OS processes
2. **Automatic Recovery** - Workers should restart without Pool intervention
3. **Clean Lifecycle** - Worker termination must clean up all associated resources
4. **Future Extensibility** - May need per-worker connection pools, caches, etc.
5. **Separation of Concerns** - Pool manages availability, not lifecycle details

---

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Direct DynamicSupervisor (Standard Pattern)

```
DynamicSupervisor (WorkerSupervisor)
└── GRPCWorker (GenServer, :transient)
```

**Implementation**:
```elixir
def start_worker(worker_id) do
  child_spec = {GRPCWorker, [id: worker_id]}
  DynamicSupervisor.start_child(__MODULE__, child_spec)
end
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Simple, standard OTP pattern
- ✅ One less process per worker
- ✅ Familiar to Elixir developers

**Cons**:
- ❌ Pool must track and handle worker restarts
- ❌ Harder to group worker + resources in future
- ❌ Less encapsulation

---

### Option 2: Worker.Starter Wrapper (Current Choice)

```
DynamicSupervisor (WorkerSupervisor)
└── Worker.Starter (Supervisor, :permanent)
    └── GRPCWorker (GenServer, :transient)
```

**Implementation**:
```elixir
def start_worker(worker_id) do
  child_spec = {Worker.Starter, {worker_id, GRPCWorker}}
  DynamicSupervisor.start_child(__MODULE__, child_spec)
end
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Automatic restarts without Pool intervention
- ✅ Worker.Starter can supervise multiple related processes
- ✅ Clean encapsulation (terminate Starter = terminate all)
- ✅ Extensible for future per-worker resources

**Cons**:
- ❌ Extra process per worker (~1KB memory)
- ❌ More complex process tree
- ❌ Non-standard pattern (requires explanation)

---

### Option 3: Worker as Supervisor

```
DynamicSupervisor (WorkerSupervisor)
└── GRPCWorker (Supervisor + GenServer hybrid)
    └── Python Process (Port)
```

**Implementation**:
```elixir
defmodule GRPCWorker do
  use Supervisor
  # Also implements GenServer-like callbacks
end
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ One fewer module
- ✅ Worker directly supervises its resources

**Cons**:
- ❌ Violates single responsibility (mixing Supervisor + GenServer)
- ❌ Complex GenServer.call routing
- ❌ Harder to reason about behavior

---

### Option 4: erlexec Integration

```
DynamicSupervisor (WorkerSupervisor)
└── GRPCWorker (GenServer)
    └── erlexec Port (C++ middleware)
        └── Python Process (guaranteed cleanup)
```

**Implementation**:
```elixir
# Use erlexec library
{:ok, pid, os_pid} = :exec.run(
  "python3 grpc_server.py",
  [monitor: true, kill_timeout: 5000, kill_group: true]
)
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Guaranteed cleanup (C++ port enforces)
- ✅ No orphans possible
- ✅ Simpler than Worker.Starter

**Cons**:
- ❌ External dependency
- ❌ Tight coupling (Python dies with BEAM)
- ❌ No independence for long-running jobs

---

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option**: **Option 2 (Worker.Starter Wrapper)**

### Justification

1. **External processes are special** - Not just Elixir GenServers
2. **Automatic restarts proven** - Works in production without Pool logic
3. **Future-proof** - Can add per-worker resources without refactoring
4. **Clean abstraction** - Terminating Starter atomically cleans up everything

### Trade-offs Accepted

**Memory**: +1KB per worker
- For 100 workers: +100KB (negligible on modern systems)
- Acceptable cost for cleaner architecture

**Complexity**: Non-standard pattern
- Requires documentation (this ADR)
- Benefits outweigh learning curve

**Process tree depth**: 3 levels instead of 2
- Observer shows deeper tree
- But clearer ownership of resources

---

## Consequences

### Positive

**Automatic Restart**:
```elixir
# Worker crashes
# Worker.Starter detects :DOWN
# Worker.Starter restarts worker automatically
# Pool gets :DOWN but doesn't need to act
```

**Atomic Cleanup**:
```elixir
# Stop a worker
DynamicSupervisor.terminate_child(WorkerSupervisor, starter_pid)
# → Starter stops
# → Worker stops
# → Python process stops
# → All cleaned up atomically
```

**Future Extensibility**:
```elixir
# v0.5: Add per-worker connection pool
children = [
  {GRPCWorker, [id: worker_id]},
  {ConnectionPool, [worker_id: worker_id]},  # Future
  {MetricsCollector, [worker_id: worker_id]} # Future
]
Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
```

### Negative

**Memory Overhead**:
- Each Worker.Starter process: ~1KB
- 100 workers: 100KB total
- Monitored but acceptable

**Conceptual Overhead**:
- Developers must understand pattern
- Not in typical Phoenix/Elixir apps
- Requires this ADR for explanation

**Debugging Complexity**:
- :observer shows 3-level tree
- Must understand which PID is which
- More processes to track

---

## Validation

### Tested Scenarios

✅ **Normal operation** (139 tests passing):
- Workers start under Starter
- Restart on crash works
- Clean shutdown works

✅ **High concurrency** (100 workers):
- Initialization: 3 seconds
- No resource leaks
- Clean shutdown

✅ **Crash recovery**:
- Worker crashes → Starter restarts
- Starter crashes → DynamicSupervisor restarts Starter+Worker
- Pool handles both gracefully

### Performance Impact

**Startup**:
- Direct: ~20ms for 4 workers
- With Starter: ~30ms for 4 workers
- Overhead: ~2.5ms per worker (negligible)

**Memory**:
- Per worker: +1KB (Worker.Starter process)
- 100 workers: +100KB total
- Acceptable on modern systems

**Runtime**:
- No performance difference
- Message routing: extra hop (microseconds)

---

## Alternatives for Future

### If Complexity Becomes Issue

**Option A**: Simplify to direct supervision
- Benchmark performance difference
- If negligible overhead, remove pattern
- Keep in v0.4.x, reconsider in v0.5

**Option B**: Adopt erlexec for coupled mode
- Guaranteed cleanup with less code
- Trade independence for simplicity
- See multi-mode architecture design

### If Resources Are Added

**Validation**: If per-worker resources materialize, pattern was correct
**Re-evaluation**: If no resources by v0.5, reconsider necessity

---

## Related Decisions

**Multi-Mode Architecture** (Future):
- `docs/20251007_external_process_supervision_design.md`
- Coupled mode (current): Keep Worker.Starter
- Supervised mode (systemd): Connect to existing pool
- Independent mode (ML): Heartbeat-based
- Distributed mode (k8s): Service mesh

**Process Cleanup**:
- DETS tracking (ProcessRegistry)
- ApplicationCleanup (emergency handler)
- beam_run_id for safe cleanup

---

## Review Schedule

**Initial Review**: 2025-10-07 (this ADR)
**Next Review**: 2025-Q2 (6 months)
**Criteria**: Check if per-worker resources were added

**Questions for Review**:
1. Did we add per-worker resources? (validates pattern)
2. Is memory overhead acceptable? (re-benchmark)
3. Is team comfortable with pattern? (survey)
4. Would simpler approach work? (prototype comparison)

## Notes

This pattern is **intentional, not accidental**. It solves real problems with managing external OS processes from Erlang. The complexity is justified by the requirements, but requires documentation (this ADR) to communicate the reasoning.

**For new team members**: Read this ADR first before questioning the pattern. If still unclear, discuss in team review.

**For future refactoring**: Benchmark direct supervision before removing. The pattern serves a purpose.
