# Agent Handoff - 2025-10-09

## Mission: Fix Test Suite Reliability & Complete Variable System Removal

You are taking over critical work on the **Snakepit** project - an Elixir process pool manager for Python worker processes. The previous agent made significant progress but there are remaining issues to resolve.

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed Work
1. **Variable system completely removed** - All variable-related code deleted (~2,200 LOC removed)
2. **Compilation warnings fixed** - Zero compilation warnings
3. **Critical PID reuse bug FIXED** - ProcessRegistry now verifies beam_run_id before killing processes
4. **Tests created** - New lifecycle and cleanup tests expose bugs
5. **Documentation created** - Full bug analysis in `docs/BUGS_IDENTIFIED_20251009.md`

### ❌ Remaining Issues
1. **1 test failure** - BridgeServerTest teardown still failing
2. **Need verification** - Run full test suite multiple times to confirm Python exit errors are gone

## What You Need to Do

### Priority 1: Fix Remaining Test Failure
**File:** `test/snakepit/grpc/bridge_server_test.exs`

**Issue:** The "ping/2 responds with pong" test fails during teardown:
```
** (exit) exited in: GenServer.call(Snakepit.Bridge.SessionStore, {:delete_session, "test_16533"}, 5000)
    ** (EXIT) no process: the process is not alive
```

**Root Cause:** The on_exit callback in setup (line 26-32) tries to call `SessionStore.delete_session` but SessionStore has already been stopped by the time teardown runs.

**Current Fix Attempt:** Added `Process.whereis` check but it's still failing intermittently.

**What to Try:**
1. Wrap the delete_session call in a try/catch that catches :exit, not just exceptions
2. Or simply remove the on_exit cleanup entirely - sessions are ephemeral and cleared on app restart
3. Run the test file individually to reproduce: `mix test test/snakepit/grpc/bridge_server_test.exs`

### Priority 2: Verify PID Reuse Fix
**File:** `lib/snakepit/pool/process_registry.ex` (lines 542-608)

**What Was Fixed:** Added beam_run_id verification before killing orphaned processes. This prevents killing NEW workers when OS reuses PIDs.

**Verification Needed:**
1. Run full test suite 5+ times: `mix test`
2. Check for ZERO occurrences of: `"Python gRPC server process exited with status 0 during startup"`
3. Check logs for: `"PID.*is a grpc_server process but with DIFFERENT beam_run_id"` - this confirms PID reuse detection is working
4. Document results in `docs/BUGS_IDENTIFIED_20251009.md`

### Priority 3: Clean Up Test Suite
The lifecycle tests we created are excellent for catching bugs, but they might be too aggressive for CI:

**Files:**
- `test/snakepit/pool/worker_lifecycle_test.exs`
- `test/snakepit/pool/application_cleanup_test.exs`

**Decision Needed:**
- Should these be tagged as `:integration` tests and excluded from default test runs?
- Or are they valuable enough to keep in the main suite?

## Critical Context

### The Architecture
Snakepit is a **process pool manager** that maintains a pool of Python gRPC worker processes:

```
Elixir Application
  └─ ProcessRegistry (DETS persistence)
  └─ Pool (manages workers)
      └─ WorkerSupervisor (DynamicSupervisor)
          └─ Worker.Starter (Supervisor per worker)
              └─ GRPCWorker (GenServer)
                  └─ Port → Python grpc_server.py process
```

**Key Invariant:** Every Python process MUST be killed when the application stops. Orphaned Python processes are unacceptable.

### The Variable System Removal
**Why:** Variables belong in the client library (DSPex), not in the core pool manager. Snakepit should be a generic process pool, not a DSP-specific tool.

**What Was Deleted:**
- `lib/snakepit/bridge/variables/` (entire directory)
- `lib/snakepit/bridge/serialization.ex`
- Variable handlers in `bridge_server.ex`
- ~100+ tests that only tested variables
- See full list in git status

**What Was Kept:**
- Session management (basic CRUD)
- Tool execution
- Worker pooling
- Process lifecycle management

### The PID Reuse Bug (CRITICAL)

**The Bug:**
1. Test run #1 starts with beam_run_id `1760067998497993_475079`
2. Python worker gets PID 410996
3. Test run #1 finishes, leaving orphaned process 410996 in DETS
4. Test run #2 starts with beam_run_id `1760068164159851_158967`
5. ProcessRegistry finds orphaned PID 410996 in DETS
6. **RACE:** OS reuses PID 410996 for a NEW worker from run #2
7. **BUG:** ProcessRegistry kills PID 410996, thinking it's from run #1
8. **RESULT:** New worker dies with "Python gRPC server process exited with status 0"

**The Fix:**
Before killing a PID, verify the process command line contains the ORIGINAL beam_run_id:
```elixir
expected_run_id_pattern = "--snakepit-run-id #{info.beam_run_id}"

if String.contains?(output, "grpc_server.py") &&
     String.contains?(output, expected_run_id_pattern) do
  # Safe to kill - it's actually the old process
else
  # PID was reused - DON'T KILL IT
end
```

This is implemented in `lib/snakepit/pool/process_registry.ex:542-608`.

10. Check `git log --oneline -20` for context

## How to Verify Your Work

### Test Suite Must Pass
```bash
# Run full suite - should have 32 tests, 0 failures
mix test

# Run multiple times to check for race conditions
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "=== Run $i ==="
  mix test 2>&1 | grep -E "tests,|Python gRPC"
done
```

### No Python Exit Errors
```bash
# Should return 0
mix test 2>&1 | grep -c "Python gRPC server process exited"
```

### No Orphaned Processes
```bash
# After test run, should be 0
ps aux | grep "grpc_server.py" | grep -v grep | wc -l
```

### Compilation Clean
```bash
# Should succeed with no warnings
mix compile --warnings-as-errors
```

## Key Files You'll Be Working With

### Most Important (Read These First)
- `lib/snakepit/pool/process_registry.ex` - Process tracking and orphan cleanup
- `test/snakepit/grpc/bridge_server_test.exs` - Failing test
- `docs/BUGS_IDENTIFIED_20251009.md` - Bug analysis

### Supporting Files
- `lib/snakepit/pool/application_cleanup.ex` - Emergency cleanup
- `lib/snakepit/grpc_worker.ex` - Worker lifecycle
- `test/snakepit/pool/worker_lifecycle_test.exs` - Lifecycle verification
- `test/test_helper.exs` - Test suite setup

## Communication Guidelines

The user (developer) is **extremely detail-oriented** and has **zero tolerance for:**
- Compilation warnings
- Test failures
- Vague explanations
- Incomplete work

**Expected behavior:**
1. Read all required files BEFORE attempting fixes
2. Explain your understanding of the bug before proposing a solution
3. Test thoroughly - run tests multiple times
4. Document all changes
5. Be precise and thorough in your analysis

**User's communication style:**
- Direct and blunt
- Values precision over politeness
- Will call out bullshit immediately
- Expects you to understand context deeply

## Success Criteria

You are done when:
1. ✅ All 32 tests pass consistently (run 5 times in a row)
2. ✅ Zero "Python gRPC server process exited" errors
3. ✅ Zero compilation warnings
4. ✅ Zero orphaned processes after test runs
5. ✅ Documentation updated in `docs/BUGS_IDENTIFIED_20251009.md`

## Questions to Answer in Your First Response

1. Have you read `docs/BUGS_IDENTIFIED_20251009.md`?
2. Do you understand the PID reuse bug and the fix?
3. What is your hypothesis for why the BridgeServerTest teardown is still failing?
4. What is your plan to fix it?

## Final Notes

- The codebase uses Elixir 1.18.4
- Tests use ExUnit
- Python workers are started via Port with Python 3.x
- DETS is used for process persistence across BEAM restarts
- Each BEAM run gets a unique run ID: `{timestamp}_{random}`

Good luck. The previous agent got us 90% there. You need to get us to 100%.
