### Core Principles for Robust Process Management

1.  **Single Source of Truth (SSoT):** There must be one, and only one, component in the system that authoritatively knows which external processes *should* be alive. This will be a persistent registry.
2.  **Lifecycle Guarantees:** We must have mechanisms that enforce state consistency at every critical point: application start, normal shutdown, worker crash, and catastrophic VM failure.
3.  **Decoupled Responsibilities:** The `Pool` should manage workers, not OS processes. The `Worker` should do its job, not manage its own cleanup guarantees. A dedicated set of components will handle process tracking and cleanup.
4.  **Leverage OS Primitives:** We must use OS-level features like process groups (PGIDs) to ensure that when we kill a process, we also kill any of its children.

### The New Architecture: Three Core Components

We will introduce two new GenServers and redefine the responsibilities of the `GRPCWorker`.

| Component                     | Role                                                                                              | Implementation      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **1. `ProcessRegistry`**      | The **Single Source of Truth**. Tracks every legitimate external process spawned by the application.  | GenServer + ETS     |
| **2. `ApplicationCleanup`**   | The **Enforcer**. Guarantees a clean slate on startup and a scorched earth on shutdown.             | GenServer           |
| **3. `GRPCWorker` (Modified)**| The **Client**. Registers its external process upon successful creation and de-registers on clean exit. | Modified GenServer  |

### 1. The `ProcessRegistry`: Your Single Source of Truth

This is the cornerstone. It's a GenServer that manages an ETS table to provide fast, concurrent reads while ensuring safe, serialized writes.

**Implementation Details:**

*   **ETS Table:** `snakepit_pool_process_registry`
*   **Access:** `:protected` (only the GenServer can write).
*   **Record Structure:** The value stored in ETS is no longer just a PID. It's a map containing all necessary information:
    ```elixir
    %{
      elixir_pid: #PID<0.1234.0>,  # The Elixir GRPCWorker PID
      os_pid: 12345,              # The OS-level PID of the Python process
      pgid: 12344,                # The OS-level Process Group ID (CRITICAL)
      fingerprint: "showcase_adapter", # Identifies the type of process
      registered_at: ~U[2023-10-27 10:00:00Z]
    }
    ```
*   **API:**
    *   `register_worker(worker_id, info_map)`: Atomically adds or updates a worker's entry.
    *   `unregister_worker(worker_id)`: Atomically removes a worker's entry.
    *   `get_all_processes()`: Returns a list of all registered process info maps.
    *   `get_worker_info(worker_id)`: Gets info for a single worker.

**Why this is robust:** The GenServer serializes all registration and unregistration requests, preventing race conditions. The ETS table provides lightning-fast lookups for the rest of the application.

### 2. The `ApplicationCleanup`: Your Enforcer

This GenServer has one job: **kill unauthorized processes**. It has no state of its own; it acts based on the `ProcessRegistry` and direct OS introspection. It must be the **first** process started in the main application supervision tree, before the pool.

**Lifecycle Responsibilities:**

**A. On `init/1` (Application Startup Guarantee):**
This is the most critical step for recovering from a catastrophic crash.

1.  **Kill Zombies from Previous Runs:** Before any new workers are started, it asks the `ProcessRegistry` for all registered PIDs. Since the application is just starting, this table *should* be empty. If it's not (e.g., Mnesia-backed ETS), it means the previous shutdown failed.
2.  **Scan the OS:** It executes an OS command like `ps aux | grep grpc_server.py`. It parses the PIDs from the output.
3.  **Cross-Reference and Kill:** It compares the list of running Python processes from the OS with the (empty) list of legitimate processes in the registry. Any process found running on the OS that isn't in the registry is an orphan from a previous run.
4.  **Issue `kill -9`:** It brutally kills the process group (`kill -9 -PGID`) of every single orphan it finds. No mercy.
5.  **Result:** The system is now in a guaranteed clean state *before* the pool even attempts to start its first worker.

**B. On `terminate/2` (Application Shutdown Guarantee):**
This is the final backstop. This GenServer traps exits and runs this logic when the application is shutting down.

1.  The application supervisor initiates shutdown, which calls `terminate` on the `Pool`, which tries to shut down workers gracefully.
2.  The `GRPCWorker`'s `terminate` hook runs, sending `SIGTERM` to the Python process and calling `ProcessRegistry.unregister_worker`.
3.  After a grace period, the `ApplicationCleanup`'s `terminate` hook is finally called.
4.  It queries `ProcessRegistry.get_all_processes()`. This list *should* be empty.
5.  Any process *still* in the registry is a hung process that failed to shut down gracefully.
6.  `ApplicationCleanup` iterates through the remaining list and issues a `kill -9 -PGID` to each one.

**C. Periodic Reaper (Self-Healing):**
The GenServer runs a `Process.send_after/3` timer to wake up every 30-60 seconds to perform a validation check, cleaning up processes from workers that may have crashed without `terminate` running.

### 3. The `GRPCWorker`: The Responsible Client

The worker's role is now simplified but more explicit.

**A. Starting the OS Process:**
When creating the `Port`, we must ensure the external process is started in a new process group. This is the key to killing it and all its children reliably.

```elixir
# In GRPCWorker.init/1
executable = "setsid" # Use the `setsid` utility
args = [adapter.executable_path(), script | adapter_args]

port_opts = [
  :binary,
  :exit_status,
  {:args, args} # `setsid` will run our script in a new session/group
]

server_port = Port.open({:spawn_executable, executable}, port_opts)
```
The OS PID we get will be for `setsid`, but the real PGID will be that of the new child process. We need a reliable way to get the PGID (often it's the same as the PID of the new group leader).

**B. Registration (`handle_continue/2`):**
*After* the Python process has started and the gRPC connection is confirmed, the worker's *final* step is to register itself.

```elixir
# After connection is confirmed
info = %{
  elixir_pid: self(),
  os_pid: state.process_pid,
  pgid: state.process_pgid, # We need to get this
  fingerprint: "showcase_adapter"
  #...
}
:ok = ProcessRegistry.register_worker(state.id, info)
```
This ensures we never register a process that failed to start correctly.

**C. Termination (`terminate/2`):**
The `terminate` callback is now simpler and more robust. It has two jobs: send a graceful shutdown signal and unregister itself.

```elixir
# In GRPCWorker.terminate/2
if state.process_pid do
  # 1. Attempt graceful shutdown (SIGTERM)
  System.cmd("kill", ["-TERM", "-#{state.process_pgid}"])
  # The ApplicationCleanup will handle SIGKILL if this fails.
end

# 2. ALWAYS unregister, even on a crash.
ProcessRegistry.unregister_worker(state.id)
```

### The Full Lifecycle Flow

1.  **App Start:** `ApplicationCleanup` starts, kills all orphan `grpc_server.py` processes on the OS. Then `ProcessRegistry` starts.
2.  **Worker Start:** The `Pool` starts a `GRPCWorker`. The worker spawns Python in a new process group, gets its PGID, connects to it, and finally registers the `{worker_id, elixir_pid, os_pid, pgid}` tuple in the `ProcessRegistry`.
3.  **Normal Use:** The system runs. The `ProcessRegistry` contains an accurate list of all legitimate running processes.
4.  **Worker Crash:** The `GRPCWorker` process dies. Its `terminate` hook runs, calling `ProcessRegistry.unregister_worker`. The `WorkerSupervisor` restarts it. The new instance starts a *new* Python process and registers itself, overwriting the (now-stale) entry for that `worker_id`. The old Python process is now an orphan. The periodic Reaper in `ApplicationCleanup` will find and kill it.
5.  **App Shutdown:** The supervision tree shuts down. `GRPCWorker.terminate` is called on all workers. They try to kill their children gracefully and unregister. After a timeout, `ApplicationCleanup.terminate` runs, finds any processes *still* in the registry, and brutally kills their process groups.

This architecture removes fragility by creating explicit, guaranteed contracts for process lifecycle management, backed by a central authority and a ruthless enforcer.
