# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation, design artifacts, and analysis files that are preserved for reference but are not part of the current active documentation.

## Directory Structure

### `specs/`
Original specification documents:

- `testOverhaul/` - Test overhaul specifications
- `proc_mgmt/` - Process management specifications

## Why These Are Archived

These documents represent the design and development process that led to the current implementation. They are valuable for:

1. **Historical Context** - Understanding why decisions were made
2. **Future Reference** - Revisiting abandoned approaches if needed
3. **Development Process** - Showing how the architecture evolved

However, they are **not maintained** as the codebase evolves. For current documentation, refer to the files in the root directory and `docs/` (excluding `docs/archive/`).

## Current Documentation

For up-to-date documentation, see:

- [Main README](../../README.md)
- [Architecture](../../ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Feature Documentation](../../README_*.md)
- [Active Docs](../) (excluding this archive directory)
