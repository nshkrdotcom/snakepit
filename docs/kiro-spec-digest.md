### v0.7.0_1_03 • Production Observability
- **Goal:** Provide production-grade telemetry with metrics, structured logs, and health probes wired through a central event bus.
- **Approach:** EventBus fan-out, Prometheus metrics consumer, JSON logger with correlation IDs, and layered health dashboards.
- **Readiness Signals:** `/metrics` scraping, configurable sampling, and LiveDashboard/Grafana packs covering pools, workers, and sessions.

### v0.7.0_1-04 • Chaos Testing Framework
- **Goal:** Stress-test Snakepit under catastrophic failures to validate resiliency guarantees before release.
- **Approach:** Orchestrated scenarios with failure injectors (process kills, partitions, resource caps), monitoring harnesses, and automated reporting.
- **Readiness Signals:** Repeatable scenario catalog, CLI to compose suites, and red/green reports with remediation notes feeding back into hardening.

### v0.7.0_2-01 • Generic Python Adapter
- **Goal:** Deliver zero-code integration for arbitrary Python libraries via discovery, metadata capture, and standardized invocation.
- **Approach:** Library manager plus Python-side introspection, type conversion pipeline for complex data (NumPy/Pandas), and caching of signatures.
- **Readiness Signals:** Declarative configs per library, optional auto-install, and telemetry on adapter function usage and latency.

### v0.7.0_2-02 • Python Environment Management
- **Goal:** Make Python environment setup “just work” across UV, Poetry, Conda, venv, system Python, and containers.
- **Approach:** Pluggable detectors, validation layer, dependency manager abstraction, and environment caching with health scoring.
- **Readiness Signals:** Uniform API for resolving interpreters, diagnostics for mismatched versions, and installation progress hooks for CI.

### v0.7.0_2-03 • Structured Error Handling & Propagation
- **Goal:** Replace ad-hoc errors with a classified, traceable system that spans Elixir and Python boundaries.
- **Approach:** Shared error taxonomy, correlation IDs, serialized Python stack traces, and telemetry/log hooks per severity class.
- **Readiness Signals:** Consistent error payloads, retry guidance embedded in responses, and dashboards for error rates by category.

### v0.7.0_3-01 • Health Check Endpoints
- **Goal:** Ship Kubernetes-friendly liveness, readiness, startup, and diagnostic HTTP probes tied to real component health.
- **Approach:** Router plus manager orchestrating provider modules (system, worker, session, dependency), response caching, and ACL support.
- **Readiness Signals:** Configurable thresholds per provider, JSON detailed health output, and probe templates for cloud load balancers.

### v0.7.0_3-02 • Migration Utilities
- **Goal:** Offer safe, auditable migrations across adapters, storage backends, and config revisions.
- **Approach:** Controller-driven planning/validation/execution/rollback cycle, scheduler integration, and audit-grade logging.
- **Readiness Signals:** Dry-run diff reports, progress telemetry, rollback automation, and CI hooks that block unsafe plans.

### v0.7.0_3-03 • Performance Monitoring
- **Goal:** Provide actionable real-time and historical performance insight across pools, sessions, and workers.
- **Approach:** High-frequency collectors, aggregators for percentiles and throughput, anomaly detection, and recommendation engine.
- **Readiness Signals:** Grafana-ready dashboards, alert wiring for saturation/latency regressions, and capacity planning exports.

### v0.7.0_3-04 • Documentation & Examples
- **Goal:** Keep production docs accurate, tested, and interactive from evaluation through operations.
- **Approach:** Doc management pipeline, automated validation of code/config samples, interactive runnable guides, and content QA gates.
- **Readiness Signals:** Multi-format outputs (HTML/PDF/API), passing example tests in CI, and contributor workflow checklists.

## v0.8.0 – Zero-Copy Platform Foundations

### v0.8.0_1_01 • Shared Memory Management
- **Goal:** Establish secure, cross-platform shared memory primitives backing zero-copy transport.
- **Approach:** Unified manager over POSIX/Mach/Win32 APIs, region registry with metadata, reference counting, and security policies.
- **Readiness Signals:** Region lifecycle telemetry, per-platform cleanup guarantees, and guardrails for quotas, permissions, and timeouts.

### v0.8.0_1_02 • Data Serialization Framework
- **Goal:** Auto-select optimal serialization paths (Arrow IPC, binary, NumPy, custom) aligned with zero-copy semantics.
- **Approach:** Serialization manager with format detector, schema registry, type mapper, and optimization layer (compression, streaming, chunking).
- **Readiness Signals:** Schema evolution support, fallback strategies logged, and performance metrics per serializer path.

### v0.8.0_1_03 • Memory Safety & Concurrency Control
- **Goal:** Guarantee safe concurrent access to shared memory across threads and processes.
- **Approach:** Synchronization manager (RW locks, semaphores, lock-free ops), deadlock detection, crash recovery, and access priority policies.
- **Readiness Signals:** Reference count audits, deadlock alerting, and stress benchmarks proving low-latency contention paths.

### v0.8.0_1_04 • Performance Optimization & Thresholds
- **Goal:** Decide dynamically when to use zero-copy vs. classic gRPC based on live workload characteristics.
- **Approach:** Decision engine with threshold manager, cost/benefit analyzer, ML-powered learning loop, and telemetry feedback.
- **Readiness Signals:** Sub-millisecond decision latency, explainable decision logs, and adaptive thresholds converging per pool.

### v0.8.0_1_05 • gRPC Protocol Extension
- **Goal:** Extend the gRPC protocol to carry zero-copy references transparently while preserving backward compatibility.
- **Approach:** Capability negotiation, message transformers, reference lifecycle manager, fallback handler, and security validation.
- **Readiness Signals:** Seamless downgrade to serialization on failure, tokenized reference validation, and compatibility tests with v0.6/v0.7 clients.
