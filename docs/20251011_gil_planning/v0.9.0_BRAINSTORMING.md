  v0.9.0 Brainstorming

  Context Analysis

  What we have:
  - v0.6.0: Dual-mode parallelism (process/thread profiles)
  - v0.7.0: Python environment abstraction (UV/Docker/Venv/etc.)
  - v0.8.0: Zero-copy data transfer (shared memory)

  What's missing:

  Option 1: Distributed Workers üåê

  "Scale Beyond One Machine"

  Problem: Current architecture limits you to workers on a single BEAM node.

  Solution: Distribute Python workers across multiple machines:

  config :snakepit,
    pools: [
      %{
        name: :distributed_ml,
        worker_distribution: :cluster,  # NEW
        nodes: [:"worker@node1", :"worker@node2", :"worker@node3"],
        worker_profile: :thread,
        pool_size: 100,  # 33 per node
        load_balancing: :least_loaded  # or :round_robin, :sticky_session
      }
    ]

  Benefits:
  - Horizontal scaling for massive ML workloads
  - GPU worker distribution (workers on GPU nodes)
  - Fault tolerance (node failure doesn't kill pool)
  - Resource isolation (Python on worker nodes, Elixir on app nodes)

  Implementation:
  - Use Distributed Erlang for worker coordination
  - Pool becomes a cluster-aware supervisor
  - Health checks across nodes
  - Session affinity with node pinning

  ---
  Option 2: Streaming Pipelines üåä

  "GenStage/Flow for Python"

  Problem: Current API is request/response. No support for continuous data streams.

  Solution: Pipeline abstraction for stream processing:

  # Define a pipeline
  pipeline = Snakepit.Pipeline.new()
    |> Snakepit.Pipeline.stage(:extract, "extract_frames", concurrency: 4)
    |> Snakepit.Pipeline.stage(:transform, "apply_model", concurrency: 8)
    |> Snakepit.Pipeline.stage(:load, "save_results", concurrency: 2)

  # Process a stream
  File.stream!("video.mp4", [], 1024)
  |> Snakepit.Pipeline.run(pipeline)
  |> Stream.each(&handle_result/1)
  |> Stream.run()

  Benefits:
  - ETL workloads (extract-transform-load)
  - Real-time video/audio processing
  - Log analysis pipelines
  - Back-pressure handling

  Implementation:
  - GenStage-based architecture
  - Workers become pipeline stages
  - Flow integration for parallel processing
  - Automatic back-pressure propagation

  ---
  Option 3: Hot Code Reloading üî•

  "Update Python Without Downtime"

  Problem: Deploying new Python code requires worker restart (downtime).

  Solution: Hot-reload Python modules without killing workers:

  # Deploy new model version
  Snakepit.HotReload.update(:ml_pool,
    module: "my_model.py",
    strategy: :blue_green  # or :rolling, :canary
  )

  # Automatic version routing
  Snakepit.execute("predict", %{version: "v2", input: data})

  Benefits:
  - Zero-downtime deployments
  - A/B testing (route 10% to v2, 90% to v1)
  - Instant rollback
  - Canary deployments

  Implementation:
  - Python importlib.reload() integration
  - Version tracking per worker
  - Gradual traffic shifting
  - Health checks for new versions

  ---
  Option 4: GPU Management üéÆ

  "First-Class GPU Support"

  Problem: No GPU awareness - users manually manage CUDA devices.

  Solution: Automatic GPU allocation and management:

  config :snakepit,
    pools: [
      %{
        name: :gpu_pool,
        worker_profile: :thread,
        gpu_enabled: true,  # NEW
        gpu_allocation: :exclusive,  # or :shared, :mig
        gpus_per_worker: 1,
        cuda_visible_devices: [0, 1, 2, 3]  # Auto-assigned
      }
    ]

  Benefits:
  - Automatic GPU assignment per worker
  - GPU utilization monitoring
  - Multi-GPU load balancing
  - CUDA error recovery

  Implementation:
  - Detect available GPUs on startup
  - Set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES per worker
  - Monitor GPU memory/utilization
  - Recycle workers on GPU OOM

  ---
  Option 5: Observability & Tracing üìä

  "Production-Grade Monitoring"

  Problem: Limited visibility into Python execution (can't trace across boundary).

  Solution: Distributed tracing from Elixir ‚Üí Python:

  # Automatic tracing
  OpenTelemetry.with_span "ml_inference" do
    Snakepit.execute("predict", %{input: data})
    # Span includes:
    # - Elixir pool queueing time
    # - Python execution time
    # - Model loading time
    # - GPU kernel time
  end

  Benefits:
  - End-to-end tracing (Elixir ‚Üí Python ‚Üí TensorFlow)
  - Performance profiling (where's the bottleneck?)
  - Error correlation across languages
  - Production debugging

  Implementation:
  - OpenTelemetry integration (Elixir + Python)
  - Span context propagation via gRPC
  - Python decorator for auto-instrumentation
  - Metrics export (Prometheus, DataDog)

  ---
  Option 6: Adaptive Scaling üìà

  "Auto-Scale Based on Load"

  Problem: Static pool size doesn't adapt to load changes.

  Solution: Dynamic worker scaling:

  config :snakepit,
    pools: [
      %{
        name: :adaptive,
        worker_profile: :process,
        pool_size: {min: 10, max: 100, target_utilization: 0.7},
        scale_up_threshold: 0.8,    # Add workers at 80% util
        scale_down_threshold: 0.3,  # Remove workers at 30% util
        scale_cooldown: 60_000      # Wait 60s between scales
      }
    ]

  Benefits:
  - Cost optimization (scale down during low traffic)
  - Handle traffic spikes (scale up automatically)
  - Resource efficiency
  - Works with Kubernetes HPA

  Implementation:
  - Monitor pool utilization
  - Add/remove workers dynamically
  - Graceful worker shutdown
  - Telemetry-driven decisions

  ---
  Option 7: Model Registry & Versioning üóÉÔ∏è

  "ML Ops Built-In"

  Problem: No standardized way to manage ML models across versions.

  Solution: Built-in model registry:

  # Register a model
  Snakepit.ModelRegistry.register(
    name: "resnet50",
    version: "v2.1.0",
    path: "/models/resnet50-v2.1.0.pt",
    metadata: %{accuracy: 0.94, size_mb: 98}
  )

  # Use specific version
  Snakepit.execute("inference", %{
    model: "resnet50:v2.1.0",  # Semantic versioning
    input: image
  })

  # Or use alias
  Snakepit.ModelRegistry.alias("resnet50:latest", "resnet50:v2.1.0")

  Benefits:
  - Model versioning (SemVer)
  - A/B testing (route traffic by version)
  - Model lineage tracking
  - Automatic cache management

  Implementation:
  - ETS-based registry
  - S3/local file backend
  - Lazy loading (load on first use)
  - LRU eviction for memory management

  ---
  Option 8: Python Interop Layer üîó

  "Call Python Like It's Native"

  Problem: Current API is command-based (strings). Not type-safe.

  Solution: Generated Elixir modules from Python code:

  # Python: my_model.py
  def predict(image: np.ndarray, threshold: float = 0.5) -> dict:
      """Run inference on image."""
      return {"class": "cat", "confidence": 0.92}

  # Generated Elixir module
  defmodule MyModel do
    @doc "Run inference on image."
    @spec predict(binary(), float()) :: {:ok, map()} | {:error, term()}
    def predict(image, threshold \\ 0.5) do
      Snakepit.execute("predict", %{image: image, threshold: threshold})
    end
  end

  # Usage (type-safe!)
  {:ok, result} = MyModel.predict(image_data, 0.7)

  Benefits:
  - Type safety (Dialyzer specs)
  - Auto-complete in IDE
  - Documentation from docstrings
  - Compile-time validation

  Implementation:
  - Parse Python type hints
  - Generate Elixir typespecs
  - Mix task: mix snakepit.gen.bindings
  - Support for TypedDict, dataclasses

  My Recommendation: v0.9.0 = Distributed Workers

  Why?

  1. Natural Evolution:
    - v0.6.0: Scale up (threads)
    - v0.7.0: Flexible deployment (environments)
    - v0.8.0: Fast data (zero-copy)
    - v0.9.0: Scale out (distributed) ‚Üê Completes the story
  2. Highest Impact:
    - Enables true horizontal scaling
    - Solves GPU allocation problem naturally
    - Production-critical feature
  3. Leverages Strengths:
    - Uses Distributed Erlang (OTP superpower)
    - Builds on v0.6.0 worker profiles
    - Compatible with v0.7.0 environments
  4. Competitive Advantage:
    - No other Elixir‚ÜîPython bridge does this
    - Enables Elixir apps to compete with Python for ML workloads

  Alternative: Option 5 (Observability) is close second
  - Production teams need this immediately
  - Easier to implement than distributed
  - Could be v0.9.0, distributed v1.0.0
