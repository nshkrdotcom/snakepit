Snakepit v0.7.0 Feature Set Recommendation
Based on the codebase analysis, current v0.6.0 status (97% test coverage, solid architecture), and the critical feedback provided, here's my recommendation for a cohesive and strategic v0.7.0 release:

ðŸŽ¯ Core Theme: Production Readiness & Distributed Foundation
v0.7.0 should focus on making Snakepit truly production-ready while laying the foundation for distributed deployments. The feedback clearly identifies critical gaps that will "bite you at scale."

Priority 1: Critical Production Gaps (Must-Have)
1. Distributed Session Registry
Problem: Current SessionStore (ETS + DETS) creates split-brain scenarios in multi-node deployments Solution: Implement swappable session storage with Horde support

# Backward compatible - existing code works unchanged
config :snakepit, session_adapter: Snakepit.SessionStore.ETS  # Default

# Multi-node production
config :snakepit, session_adapter: MyApp.SessionStore.Horde   # User choice
Impact: Enables true multi-node deployments without state synchronization issues

2. Heartbeat Pattern for Process Management
Problem: Current process cleanup relies on external tools, creating operational complexity Solution: Implement BEAM-native heartbeat + self-termination pattern

# Python side: Self-terminate if BEAM crashes
def heartbeat_loop(stdout):
    while True:
        try:
            stdout.write("HEARTBEAT\n")
            stdout.flush()
            time.sleep(2)
        except BrokenPipeError:
            sys.exit(0)  # BEAM died, clean exit
Impact: Eliminates orphaned processes, removes supervisord dependency

3. Production-Grade Observability
Problem: Current telemetry is insufficient for production debugging Solution: Complete telemetry integration with Prometheus/Grafana

# Comprehensive event taxonomy
[:snakepit, :worker, :crash]
[:snakepit, :pool, :saturated] 
[:snakepit, :request, :executed]
# + Health check endpoints, structured logging, error correlation
Impact: Operators can debug live systems, prevent outages

Priority 2: Developer Experience (Should-Have)
4. Python Environment Abstraction
Problem: #1 friction point - "How do I get my Python environment to work?" Solution: Environment behavior pattern (similar to WorkerProfile)

config :snakepit,
  python_environment: :uv,  # or :venv, :conda, :docker, :system
  auto_install: true        # pip install requirements automatically
Impact: Eliminates setup friction, "just works" experience

5. Generic Python Adapter System
Problem: Adding new Python libraries requires custom adapter code Solution: Zero-code library integration

config :snakepit,
  python_libraries: [
    %{name: "docling", module: "docling.document_converter", pip_package: "docling"}
  ]

# Use immediately
{:ok, result} = Snakepit.execute("python.docling.parse_pdf", %{file_path: "/doc.pdf"})
Impact: Rapid prototyping, test libraries in minutes not hours

Priority 3: Reliability & Testing (Should-Have)
6. Chaos Testing Framework
Problem: No systematic testing of failure scenarios Solution: Comprehensive chaos testing suite

# Test BEAM crashes, network partitions, resource exhaustion
mix test --only chaos
Impact: Confidence in production failure handling

7. Enhanced Error Handling
Problem: Python exceptions are swallowed, hard to debug Solution: Structured error propagation with Python tracebacks

{:error, %{type: "ValueError", traceback: "...", context: %{...}}}
Impact: Faster debugging, better error visibility

Strategic Rationale
Why This Feature Set?
Addresses Critical Feedback: The senior engineer review identified distributed state, process management, and observability as "critical production gaps that will bite you at scale"

Natural Evolution: v0.6.0 delivered dual-mode parallelism (process/thread). v0.7.0 should focus on production deployment and multi-node readiness

User Pain Points: Python environment setup is the #1 adoption friction. Generic adapter eliminates the #2 friction (custom code for each library)

Foundation for v0.8.0: Distributed session registry enables the planned zero-copy data transfer and advanced distributed features

What NOT to Include
Zero-Copy Data Transfer: Move to v0.8.0. It's an optimization, not a production requirement
Advanced ML Features: Keep Snakepit as infrastructure, not domain-specific
Complex Distributed Features: Focus on foundation (session registry) not advanced coordination
Implementation Timeline
Week 1-2: Distributed session registry (adapter pattern + Horde implementation) Week 3: Heartbeat pattern (Python + Elixir sides)
Week 4: Production observability (telemetry + health checks) Week 5: Python environment abstraction Week 6: Generic adapter system + chaos testing

Total: 6 weeks for a production-ready, distributed-foundation release

Success Metrics
âœ… Zero breaking changes (100% v0.6.0 compatibility)
âœ… Multi-node deployment ready (session registry + heartbeat)
âœ… Production observability (Prometheus integration)
âœ… Friction elimination (environment + generic adapters)
âœ… Reliability confidence (chaos testing)
This feature set transforms Snakepit from "impressive architecture" to "production-ready distributed Python bridge" - exactly what the feedback indicates is needed for serious adoption.
