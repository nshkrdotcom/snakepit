### Feedback for `snakepit`

You've asked for a critical review to help make `snakepit` the premier external language orchestrator for Elixir. That's a bold and worthy goal. With that in mind, here is my feedback, looking at the project from a strategic, architectural, and operational perspective.

#### 1. The Core Architectural Challenge: The Orphaned Process Problem

You've correctly identified the biggest challenge with any external process manager on the BEAM: what happens when the BEAM itself goes down unexpectedly? Your idea of using `supervisord` is a valid approach, but I'd challenge you to consider a more BEAM-centric solution first, as it might align better with the ecosystem's philosophy.

**The Problem with `supervisord`:**
It introduces a heavy, stateful, external dependency. Now, not only does your application need Elixir/Erlang installed, but it also requires `supervisord` to be configured and running. This increases the operational burden and creates another major component that can fail.

**Alternative, BEAM-centric Solutions to Consider:**

1.  **The Heartbeat & Self-Termination Pattern:** This is a classic.
    *   The BEAM port regularly expects a "heartbeat" message from the Python worker over its `stdout`.
    *   If the BEAM doesn't receive a heartbeat within a timeout (e.g., 2-3 intervals), it assumes the Python worker is frozen, kills it (`Port.close/1`), and lets the Elixir supervisor restart it.
    *   Crucially, if the Python worker tries to write its heartbeat to `stdout` and the pipe is broken (because the BEAM VM crashed), the write will fail. The Python worker should catch this `BrokenPipeError` and **immediately self-terminate**. This elegantly solves the orphan problem for unexpected BEAM crashes.

2.  **The "Watchdog" or "Babysitter" Process:**
    *   When your Elixir code starts a Python worker via a port, it could also start a tiny, independent "watchdog" process.
    *   This watchdog is given two PIDs: the PID of the BEAM VM and the PID of the Python worker it's supposed to watch.
    *   The watchdog's *only job* is to poll every few seconds. If it sees that the BEAM PID no longer exists, it immediately sends a `SIGTERM` to the Python worker's PID and then exits. This is extremely robust against BEAM crashes. The watchdog itself can be a simple shell script or a tiny compiled binary (Go, Rust, etc.) for minimal overhead.

My recommendation is to **thoroughly explore the Heartbeat pattern first**, as it requires no external dependencies and is a well-understood pattern for managing resources that must be tied to the lifecycle of a BEAM port.

#### 2. Strategic Vision: From Local Orchestrator to Distributed Orchestrator

Your endgame of "completely decoupled execution environments" is the right one. This implies moving from same-node communication (via ports) to network communication.

*   **Define a Wire Protocol:** The port-based communication is implicitly a "protocol." Before you can go distributed, you need to formalize this. Define a clear, versioned, network-agnostic protocol for communication between the BEAM and a worker.
    *   Consider using something like Protocol Buffers or even just a simple JSON-RPC spec over a TCP socket.
    *   Doing this now will force you to decouple the *what* (the commands and data) from the *how* (the transport mechanism: port, TCP, etc.).

*   **Introduce a "Snakepit Agent":** Thinking ahead, the distributed model probably looks like a small "agent" running on a remote machine. The BEAM node would talk to this agent over the network, and the agent would be responsible for managing a local pool of Python processes on that machine. This agent is the perfect place to implement the robust lifecycle management we discussed above.

#### 3. Developer Experience & Production Readiness

To become the "goto" library, `snakepit` needs to be not just powerful, but also easy and safe to use in production.

*   **Observability is Non-Negotiable:**
    *   Integrate with `:telemetry`. Emit events for key lifecycle moments: `[:snakepit, :worker, :start]`, `[:snakepit, :worker, :stop]`, `[:snakepit, :worker, :crash]`, `[:snakepit, :job, :execute, :start | :stop | :exception]`.
    *   This allows adopters to immediately hook `snakepit` into their existing monitoring dashboards (Prometheus, Grafana, LiveDashboard) and track worker pool health, job throughput, and error rates. This is a massive selling point for production use.

*   **Error Propagation:**
    *   How does a Python-side exception look on the Elixir side? Right now, it probably just crashes the port. Can you trap exceptions in the Python wrapper, serialize the stack trace, and send it back to the calling Elixir process as a structured error tuple (`{:error, {:python_exception, type, message, stack_trace}}`)? This would make debugging a million times easier.

*   **Testing for Catastrophe:**
    *   You have great test coverage, which is awesome. Now, add tests for the failure modes. Write a test that spins up a worker and then programmatically kills the BEAM VM (`os.cmd("kill -9 ...")` inside an `ExUnit.after_suite` hook is a blunt but effective way to simulate this). The test then becomes an external script that checks if the Python process was actually cleaned up. This will give you ultimate confidence in your process management solution.

#### Summary of Actionable Feedback:

1.  **Prioritize solving the orphaned process problem.** Implement and document the **heartbeat pattern** as the primary mechanism.
2.  **Formalize the communication layer.** Start designing a **wire protocol** to prepare for future distributed capabilities.
3.  **Instrument everything.** Add `:telemetry` events for all important lifecycle and execution events. This is a huge step towards being "production-ready."
4.  **Improve error handling.** Propagate Python exceptions back to Elixir as structured data, not just crashes.
5.  **Beef up the documentation.** You're doing great with ADRs. Expand this with a "Cookbook" section showing recipes for common use cases (e.g., "Running a FastAPI model," "Interfacing with a Pandas script").

You have a solid foundation and, more importantly, the right attitude and a clear vision. The path from a good library to a "goto" library is paved with this kind of operational robustness and obsessive focus on the developer experience.

Keep up the incredible work. I'm excited to see where you take this.
