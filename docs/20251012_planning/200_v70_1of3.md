Snakepit v0.7.0 - Recommended Feature Set
ðŸŽ¯ Core Theme: Production-Ready External Language Orchestration
Building on the solid v0.6.0 foundation (dual-mode parallelism, multi-pool architecture), v0.7.0 should focus on making Snakepit the definitive production-grade bridge for external language integrations in Elixir.

Priority 1: Distributed State & Resilience
Address the critical feedback about distributed systems

1.1 Distributed Session Registry
Problem: Current ETS/DETS SessionStore doesn't survive node failures or scale across clusters
Solution: Implement swappable session adapters with Horde support
Implementation:
# Default (backward compatible)
config :snakepit, session_adapter: Snakepit.SessionStore.ETS

# Distributed (user opts in)
config :snakepit, session_adapter: MyApp.SessionStore.Horde
Impact: Enables multi-node deployments, session survival across node failures
1.2 Heartbeat-Based Process Management
Problem: Current supervisord approach adds complexity and hides failures
Solution: Implement BEAM-native heartbeat pattern with self-termination
Implementation: Python workers send heartbeats, self-terminate on broken pipe
Impact: Zero external dependencies, visible failures, automatic cleanup
1.3 Chaos Testing Framework
Problem: Current tests don't validate catastrophic failure scenarios
Solution: Comprehensive chaos testing for BEAM crashes, network partitions, resource exhaustion
Implementation: External test scripts, property-based testing, CI integration
Impact: Production confidence, early bug detection
Priority 2: Observability & Production Operations
Make Snakepit observable and debuggable in production

2.1 Comprehensive Telemetry Integration
Problem: Limited production visibility into worker health and performance
Solution: Full :telemetry integration with Prometheus/Grafana support
Implementation:
# Key events
[:snakepit, :worker, :start | :stop | :crash | :heartbeat_timeout]
[:snakepit, :pool, :saturated | :capacity_reached]
[:snakepit, :session, :create | :destroy | :timeout]
[:snakepit, :request, :execute, :start | :stop | :exception]
Impact: Production monitoring, alerting, performance optimization
2.2 Structured Error Handling & Propagation
Problem: Python exceptions are swallowed, making debugging difficult
Solution: Structured error codes with Python traceback propagation
Implementation: Error taxonomy, Pythonâ†’Elixir exception bridging, correlation IDs
Impact: Faster debugging, better error reporting, operational clarity
2.3 Health Check & Diagnostics API
Problem: No standardized way to check system health
Solution: HTTP health endpoints, worker diagnostics, pool inspection tools
Implementation: /health, /metrics, enhanced mix snakepit.inspect tasks
Impact: Kubernetes readiness probes, operational dashboards
Priority 3: Generic Python Adapter System
Enable zero-code integration with any Python library

3.1 Configuration-Driven Library Loading
Problem: Adding new Python libraries requires custom adapter code
Solution: Generic adapter that loads libraries via configuration
Implementation:
config :snakepit,
  python_libraries: [
    %{name: "docling", module: "docling.document_converter", pip_package: "docling"},
    %{name: "pandas", module: "pandas", pip_package: "pandas"}
  ]

# Usage
{:ok, result} = Snakepit.execute("python.docling.parse_pdf", %{file_path: "/doc.pdf"})
Impact: Rapid prototyping, zero custom code for 90% of libraries
3.2 Automatic Function Discovery & Type Mapping
Problem: Manual function registration and type conversion
Solution: Introspection-based discovery with automatic type coercion
Implementation: Python inspect module, automatic gRPC stub generation
Impact: Drop-in library support, reduced maintenance burden
3.3 Advanced Type System
Problem: Limited support for complex Python types (NumPy, Pandas, etc.)
Solution: Pluggable serialization with binary optimization for large data
Implementation: Threshold-based binary encoding, streaming for generators
Impact: Support for ML/AI workloads, efficient data transfer
Priority 4: Developer Experience Enhancements
Make Snakepit easier to adopt and debug

4.1 Enhanced Documentation & Examples
Problem: Complex setup process, limited real-world examples
Solution: Comprehensive cookbook with production patterns
Implementation:
Installation automation scripts
Docker compose examples
Kubernetes deployment templates
Real-world use case tutorials (Docling, ML inference, data processing)
Impact: Faster adoption, reduced support burden
4.2 Development Tools & Debugging
Problem: Limited tooling for development and debugging
Solution: Enhanced Mix tasks and debugging utilities
Implementation:
mix snakepit.setup          # Automated environment setup
mix snakepit.doctor         # Health diagnostics
mix snakepit.trace          # Request tracing
mix snakepit.benchmark      # Performance testing
Impact: Better developer experience, faster debugging
4.3 Migration & Compatibility Tools
Problem: Upgrading between versions can be complex
Solution: Automated migration tools and compatibility checks
Implementation: Config migration scripts, deprecation warnings, compatibility matrix
Impact: Smoother upgrades, reduced breaking changes
Priority 5: Performance & Scalability
Optimize for production workloads

5.1 Advanced Pool Management
Problem: Static pool sizing doesn't adapt to load
Solution: Dynamic scaling with load-based worker adjustment
Implementation: Auto-scaling policies, backpressure handling, circuit breakers
Impact: Better resource utilization, automatic load adaptation
5.2 Connection Pooling & Optimization
Problem: gRPC connection overhead for high-frequency requests
Solution: Connection pooling, request batching, keep-alive optimization
Implementation: Persistent connections, request multiplexing, connection health checks
Impact: Lower latency, higher throughput, reduced resource usage
5.3 Memory Management & Worker Lifecycle
Problem: Long-running workers can accumulate memory leaks
Solution: Enhanced worker recycling with memory monitoring
Implementation: Memory threshold recycling, graceful worker replacement, leak detection
Impact: Stable long-running deployments, predictable memory usage

Why This Feature Set?
Addresses Critical Feedback: Directly tackles distributed systems, process management, and observability concerns raised in the reviews

Production Focus: Every feature is designed for real production deployments, not just development convenience

Backward Compatible: All changes maintain 100% compatibility with existing v0.6.0 deployments

Strategic Positioning: Positions Snakepit as the definitive external language bridge for Elixir, competing with solutions like Ports, NIFs, and custom bridges

Ecosystem Integration: Deep integration with BEAM ecosystem (telemetry, OTP supervision, distributed Erlang) rather than external dependencies

This feature set transforms Snakepit from a "good Python bridge" into the premier external language orchestration platform for the BEAM ecosystem, ready for enterprise production deployments.
