Snakepit v0.7.0: "Production-Ready Bridge" - Cohesive Feature Set
Core Theme: Operational Excellence & Developer Experience
v0.7.0 should focus on making Snakepit truly production-ready while dramatically improving the developer experience. The feedback clearly identifies the key gaps that prevent widespread adoption.

🎯 Priority 1: Critical Production Features
1. Robust Process Management (Addresses Feedback Priority #1)
Heartbeat Pattern Implementation - Replace supervisord approach with BEAM-native solution
Orphaned Process Prevention - Self-terminating Python workers on BEAM crash
Watchdog Process - Lightweight shell script for paranoid scenarios
Process Lifecycle Telemetry - Full observability of worker health
Why Critical: The feedback identified this as the #1 blocker for production use. Current process management is fragile.

2. Production Telemetry & Observability (Addresses Feedback Priority #2)
Comprehensive Telemetry Events - All worker lifecycle, pool operations, errors
Prometheus Integration - Built-in metrics for Grafana dashboards
Structured Error Handling - Python exceptions propagated with full context
Health Check Endpoints - Kubernetes-ready liveness/readiness probes
Performance Monitoring - Request duration, throughput, error rates
Why Critical: "Observability is non-negotiable for production" - current telemetry is insufficient.

3. Chaos Testing Framework (Addresses Feedback Priority #3)
Automated Failure Testing - BEAM crashes, network partitions, resource exhaustion
CI Integration - Nightly chaos tests to catch regressions
Property-Based Testing - Verify invariants under random failures
External Process Validation - Ensure no zombie processes after crashes
Why Critical: Current tests are timing-dependent and unreliable. Production systems need chaos validation.

🚀 Priority 2: Developer Experience Revolution
4. Generic Python Adapter System (New - Addresses Adoption Friction)
# Zero-code integration for any Python library
config :snakepit,
  python_libraries: [
    %{name: "docling", module: "docling.document_converter", pip_package: "docling"},
    %{name: "pandas", module: "pandas", pip_package: "pandas"}
  ]

# Immediate usage
{:ok, result} = Snakepit.execute("python.docling.parse_pdf", %{file_path: "/path/to/doc.pdf"})
Impact: Eliminates the #1 adoption barrier - custom adapter development. Any Python library becomes usable in minutes.

5. Python Environment Management (Addresses Real-World Deployment Pain)
Auto-Detection - UV, Poetry, Conda, Docker, system Python
Declarative Configuration - Specify environment type, let Snakepit handle details
Dependency Management - Automatic pip install, version validation
Environment Isolation - Per-pool Python environments
Why Critical: Current "find python3" approach breaks in real deployments with complex Python setups.

🔧 Priority 3: Architectural Improvements
6. Session Store Adapter Pattern (Foundation for Future Distribution)
Pluggable Session Storage - ETS (default), Horde (distributed), custom
Migration Utilities - Safe transition between storage backends
Backward Compatibility - Zero breaking changes for existing users
Performance Optimization - Maintain <1ms latency for ETS
Why Important: Sets foundation for distributed sessions without forcing complexity on single-node users.

7. Enhanced Error Recovery
Circuit Breakers - Stop sending requests to failing workers
Automatic Retry Logic - Configurable retry policies with backoff
Graceful Degradation - Partial functionality during worker failures
Error Classification - Distinguish transient vs permanent failures
📚 Priority 4: Documentation & Ecosystem
8. Production Deployment Guide
Kubernetes Manifests - Ready-to-use YAML with best practices
Docker Images - Official containers with optimized Python environments
Monitoring Setup - Grafana dashboards, Prometheus rules
Troubleshooting Playbook - Common issues and solutions
9. Developer Cookbook
Library Integration Examples - Docling, Pandas, PyTorch, Transformers
Performance Tuning Guide - Pool sizing, worker profiles, memory management
Testing Strategies - Unit, integration, and chaos testing patterns
Migration Guides - From v0.6.0, from other Python bridges
🎯 Success Metrics for v0.7.0
Production Readiness
✅ 99.9% uptime in production deployments
✅ Zero orphaned processes after BEAM crashes
✅ <10ms P95 latency for session operations
✅ Comprehensive monitoring dashboards
Developer Experience
✅ Add new Python library in <5 minutes (vs hours currently)
✅ Zero custom adapter code for 90% of libraries
✅ Auto-detection works for 95% of Python environments
✅ Clear error messages for all failure modes
Ecosystem Growth
✅ 10+ example integrations (Docling, Pandas, PyTorch, etc.)
✅ Community contributions for new libraries
✅ Production case studies from early adopters
🚫 Explicitly NOT in v0.7.0
Deferred to v0.8.0+
Distributed Sessions - Foundation laid, full implementation later
Zero-Copy Data Transfer - Optimization for specific workloads
Multi-Node Worker Distribution - Complex distributed coordination
Advanced ML Optimizations - Specialized features for ML workloads
Rationale: v0.7.0 focuses on making Snakepit production-ready and easy to adopt. Advanced features come after the foundation is solid.

💡 Why This Feature Set?
Addresses Critical Feedback - Every priority item from the expert reviews
Removes Adoption Barriers - Generic adapter eliminates custom code requirement
Production-Ready - Comprehensive observability and failure handling
Backward Compatible - Zero breaking changes for existing users
Foundation for Future - Sets up distributed capabilities without forcing complexity
Bottom Line: v0.7.0 transforms Snakepit from "promising library" to "production-ready platform" while making it dramatically easier to use. This positions it as the definitive Elixir↔Python bridge.

The feedback was clear: focus on operational robustness and developer experience before advanced features. This feature set delivers exactly that.
