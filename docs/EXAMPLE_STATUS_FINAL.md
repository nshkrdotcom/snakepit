## Summary

**Process Cleanup: 100% SUCCESS**
- All examples achieve zero orphaned processes
- Supervision tree cleanup works perfectly
- GRPCWorker.terminate/2 now called correctly

**Example Functionality: 6/8 PASS**
- 6 core gRPC examples work perfectly
- 1 has streaming API issue (not cleanup related)
- 1 is non-pooling example (different use case)

**Critical Achievement: ZERO ORPHANS ACROSS ALL TESTS**
