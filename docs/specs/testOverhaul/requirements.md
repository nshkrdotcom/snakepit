# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves implementing a comprehensive test infrastructure overhaul for the Snakepit library using the Supertester framework to establish OTP-compliant testing patterns, ensure test reliability, and provide proper test coverage for all components. The current minimal test suite lacks coverage of critical components including the pool system, worker management, session handling, and adapter patterns.

The overhaul will integrate Snakepit with the Supertester test infrastructure library (github.com/nshkrdotcom/supertester) following the established code standards in docs/code-standards/comprehensive-otp-testing-standards.md. This will create a complete test suite covering unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, and chaos engineering scenarios using Supertester's proven OTP testing helpers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Snakepit, I want Supertester-based test coverage for all library components so that I can trust the library's reliability following OTP best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the test suite THEN all core modules SHALL have at least 90% test coverage using Supertester helpers
2. WHEN I examine test code THEN it SHALL follow the comprehensive-otp-testing-standards.md patterns
3. WHEN I run tests THEN they SHALL use async: true with Supertester's isolation helpers
4. IF I make changes to the codebase THEN tests SHALL catch regressions using Supertester assertions
5. WHEN tests fail THEN Supertester helpers SHALL provide detailed OTP-aware diagnostics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want OTP-compliant pool management testing using Supertester so that I can ensure proper GenServer patterns for worker lifecycle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I test pool initialization THEN it SHALL use Supertester.OTPHelpers.setup_isolated_genserver
2. WHEN I test worker management THEN it SHALL use Supertester's process lifecycle monitoring
3. WHEN I test request distribution THEN it SHALL use Supertester.GenServerHelpers for synchronization
4. IF workers fail THEN Supertester.Assertions SHALL verify proper supervisor recovery
5. WHEN testing pool saturation THEN Supertester.PerformanceHelpers SHALL measure behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want to eliminate all Process.sleep usage and follow OTP testing standards using Supertester's proven patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I test GenServer processes THEN they SHALL use Supertester.GenServerHelpers.cast_and_sync
2. WHEN I test supervision trees THEN they SHALL use Supertester.SupervisorHelpers
3. WHEN I test process lifecycle THEN it SHALL use Supertester.OTPHelpers monitoring functions
4. IF processes crash THEN Supertester SHALL use wait_for_process_restart without sleep
5. WHEN testing concurrent operations THEN Supertester.GenServerHelpers.concurrent_calls SHALL ensure safety

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want session management testing using Supertester's isolation patterns so that I can ensure proper OTP-compliant session handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I test session creation THEN it SHALL use Supertester.DataGenerators.unique_session_id
2. WHEN I test session affinity THEN it SHALL use Supertester's isolated process tracking
3. WHEN I test session cleanup THEN it SHALL use Supertester.OTPHelpers.cleanup_on_exit
4. IF sessions timeout THEN Supertester.Assertions SHALL verify cleanup without timing issues
5. WHEN testing concurrent sessions THEN Supertester.UnifiedTestFoundation SHALL ensure isolation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a library user, I want adapter pattern testing using Supertester mocking patterns so that I can create custom adapters following OTP standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I test adapter behavior THEN it SHALL use Supertester mock adapter patterns
2. WHEN I test custom adapters THEN Supertester.DataGenerators SHALL provide test scenarios
3. WHEN I test adapter failures THEN Supertester.ChaosHelpers SHALL inject controlled failures
4. IF adapters misbehave THEN Supertester.Assertions SHALL verify defensive handling
5. WHEN testing adapter lifecycle THEN Supertester.OTPHelpers SHALL manage process cleanup

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious developer, I want Supertester.PerformanceHelpers-based testing so that I can benchmark Snakepit against established baselines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run performance tests THEN Supertester.PerformanceHelpers SHALL measure metrics
2. WHEN I run stress tests THEN Supertester SHALL use workload_pattern_test scenarios
3. WHEN I test under load THEN Supertester.PerformanceHelpers.concurrent_load_test SHALL apply
4. IF performance regresses THEN Supertester.PerformanceHelpers.performance_regression_detector SHALL alert
5. WHEN benchmarking THEN Supertester SHALL provide benchmark_with_thresholds validation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer debugging issues, I want Supertester.ChaosHelpers-based resilience testing so that I can ensure Snakepit survives real-world failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I inject worker failures THEN Supertester.ChaosHelpers.inject_process_failure SHALL test recovery
2. WHEN I simulate network issues THEN Supertester.ChaosHelpers.simulate_network_corruption SHALL apply
3. WHEN I create resource exhaustion THEN Supertester.ChaosHelpers.create_memory_pressure SHALL test limits
4. IF multiple failures occur THEN Supertester.ChaosHelpers.chaos_test_orchestrator SHALL coordinate
5. WHEN testing recovery THEN Supertester.ChaosHelpers.verify_system_recovery SHALL validate state

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a team member, I want test documentation aligned with comprehensive-otp-testing-standards.md so that I can follow established Supertester patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read test documentation THEN it SHALL reference Supertester helpers and OTP standards
2. WHEN I need test examples THEN they SHALL demonstrate Supertester usage patterns
3. WHEN I write new tests THEN I SHALL follow the code standards document templates
4. IF tests fail in CI THEN Supertester's detailed diagnostics SHALL aid debugging
5. WHEN onboarding developers THEN they SHALL learn both Snakepit and Supertester patterns
